## Developer's guide

You would need a console environment, `lua 5.1`ï¼Œ`luarocks` <https://luarocks.org/> and the following `luarocks` packages.

* `luafilesystem` latest version
* `lpeg` 0.9-1 DON'T use latest version!

Translation tools is under `i18n_tools` directory.

The translation preparation will includes those steps:

* Change dir to `i18n_tools`.
* Run `lua i18n_extractor.lua ../game/engines ../game/modules/tome ../game/dlcs ../game/addons >tmp.log` to extract any text in the game to `i18n_list.lua` file.
* Run `lua i18n_helper.lua` . It will rearrange and deduplicate all text in  `merge_translation.lua`, and print the rearranged translation file to `output_translation.lua` and or untranslated texts to  `untranslated.lua`
* It will also generate `game/engines/data/locales/ko_KR.lua`, which is used by the game.
* You can add tranlation texts in the end of `merge_translation.lua` and repeat runing `lua i18n_helper.lua` to rearrange it, after this, you should use `output_translation.lua` to replace `merge_translation.lua`.
