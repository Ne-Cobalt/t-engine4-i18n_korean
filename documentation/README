Building
========
Building the documentation requires [LDoc](https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc)  
It has a dependency of [Penlight](https://github.com/stevedonovan/Penlight)  
And optionally you can install [lua-discount](https://github.com/craigbarnes/lua-discount) for better markdown processing of comments  

Both dependencies can be found with luarocks if you have that

Just point ldoc.lua at the directory this README file is contained in and it will handle the rest:
	t-engine-source $ cd documentation
	t-engine-source/documentation $ lua /path/to/ldoc.lua .

After building the documentation, it will output into `tengine_doc` one directory below
You can alter this path by including `-d path` when calling ldoc
