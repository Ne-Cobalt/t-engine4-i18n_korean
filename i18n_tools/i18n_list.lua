I am #{italic}##ANTIQUE_WHITE#DarkGod#LAST##{normal}#, the creator of the game and before you go on your merry way I wish to take a few seconds of your time to explain why there are microtransactions in the game.\
\
Before you run off in terror let me put it plainly: I am very #{bold}#firmly #CRIMSON#against#LAST# pay2win#{normal}# things so rest assured I will not add this kind of stuff.\
\
So why put microtransactions? Tales of Maj'Eyal is a cheap/free game and has no subscription required to play. It is my baby and I love it; I plan to work on it for many years to come (as I do since 2009!) but for it to be viable I must ensure a steady stream of income as this is sadly the state of the world we live in.\
\
As for what kind of purchases are/will be available:\
- #GOLD#Cosmetics#LAST#: in addition to the existing racial cosmetics & item shimmers available in the game you can get new packs of purely cosmetic items & skins to look even more dapper!\
- #GOLD#Pay2DIE#LAST#: Tired of your character? End it with style!\
- #GOLD#Vault space#LAST#: For those that donated they can turn all those \"useless\" donations into even more online vault slots.\
- #GOLD#Community events#LAST#: A few online events are automatically and randomly triggered by the server. With those options you can force one of them to trigger; bonus point they trigger for the whole server so everybody online benefits from them each time!\
\
I hope I've convinced you of my non-evil intentions (ironic for a DarkGod I know ;)). I must say feel dirty doing microtransactions even as benign as those but I want to find all the ways I can to ensure the game's future.\
Thanks, and have fun!") -- _t

Excavation of Sher'Tul ruins almost complete. Markings seem to match previous ruins in the south.\
Current theory: Possibly a portal of some kind? We have only rumours and myths of the Sher'Tul, and all say they could travel Eyal in the blink of an eye. Mana readings of the place are beyond anything we can even begin to comprehend. Last diviner I sent down there is still in a coma. Must continue studies.\

Thanks to one of our scouting parties catching a Conclave lieutenant's squad off-guard, we have found directions to a noteworthy laboratory hidden underground, in what's newly Nargol territory.  Unfortunately, the long-legs scuttled the entrances before we could arrive, and it'd take us years to dig ourselves in, even if we could afford recalling our geomancers from the front lines to work on it - which we can't.  \
\
Your new objective is to find a way to warp a recovery team inside to scavenge it, then get them back safely with their data in tow.  It's possible that they've figured out a way to ward it against teleportation; enclosed is a key, in case it's necessary to target a point between the obstruction and the entrance.  I don't want to hear any of your nonsense about it being \"impossible\" without a linked portal near the destination; thirty years ago, you would've told me that almost everything you're now doing on a daily basis is impossible.\

I know you think yourself \"above\" such \"petty politics\" like how vital this facility would be to our survival, so I won't bore you with stressing how important this is to us.

I thought I'd have no trouble with motivation, helping our wounded get back to health again, but seeing so many of them, and knowing there are some I cannot help...  it weighs heavily on my mind.  It would be difficult to go on, if I did not keep a few things in mind: \
\
One, that I am truly doing the best I can to minimize the world's suffering, both directly by healing, and indirectly by ensuring that the world will be united under the wise, thoughtful rule of the Conclave.  Ready access to regeneration infusions ensures that even the most dire of wounds can be healed in a matter of days, and the soldiers can return to the battlefield; furthermore, the Overseers have granted us access to their amnesia-inducing spells, allowing us to properly treat those who have been traumatized by the horrors of battle.  May the eyes of the Higher watch over this world for thousands of years to come.\
\
Two, that the \"side project\" the Overseers have assigned me to is working out very well.  Those wounded who have consented to our trial treatments, consisting of a unique combination of experimental variations on heroism infusions and shielding runes, have experienced slightly increased physical strength and endurance, with no sign of the effects wearing off.  There is one mild side effect which has given me cause to worry, though I dare not speak of my misgivings to anyone else; some of those treated have needed to be disciplined for getting too \"enthusiastic\" in battle.  The Overseers have assured me that this is actually having a net positive effect on morale, and thus I can wait to cure these aggressive tendencies until the war is over.  In the meantime, I am proud of my work, and although it's nothing so glorious as the creation of the Higher race, it will be a tremendous boon to our society in the long term.\
\
And three, that the war will soon be over, and with it we shall no longer have to bear the maiming of our proud soldiers and the impudence of the Nargol.  We have made impressive gains in territory in the last few days, thwarting numerous ambushes and keeping our momentum as we expand further into Nargol lands.  Granted, one cannot be sure of how much of what we're hearing has been \"cleaned up\" by the Overseers, but one recent statement from the Nargol leads me to believe it is the truth:\
\
\"This is your last chance to back down.  A great tragedy will ensue if you continue to push further, and do not accept our previously-stated terms of peaceful resolution.  Do not force us to do this.\"\
\
After waging a war of trickery and deceit, those halflings think they can bluff us!  Once their military is broken, we can bring their citizens into our fold and enlighten them, and then the true healing can begin.") -- _t

tDef(205, "The Nargol were not bluffing, and what they did was worse than anything we could've imagined.  The details coming from the survivors - of which there are both far too many and far too few - are conflicting at times, but from what I can tell...\
\
As our forces began their final push, the ground began to rumble and give way behind them, and the bones of the war's fallen (halflings and Conclave alike) began to rise up, then draw their once-discarded weapons and rush at our soldiers in a frenzy.  There were so many...  those who were on higher ground when it happened said it was like a sea of bones and rotting flesh.  Outnumbered, our forces broke ranks and tried to retreat, but with the halflings in front of them and the abominations behind them, we took tremendous losses...  and our humble medical center is overflowing with the gravely wounded.  Many come to us with a terrible sickness passed on by the Nargol's ghouls; there is no cure for this, and I have already had to \"mercifully\" end the lives of over a dozen men and women to save them from a long, drawn-out death, ending in their transfiguration into one of those horrid creatures...  including--\
\
[The end of the preceding paragraph, several lines' worth of text, has been furiously scribbled out.]\
\
No...  the real horrid creatures here are the halflings.  We've seen necromancy before, but mostly as a parlor trick by deranged cults; we never dreamed that any large organization would tolerate it, let alone hide necromantic charms on every one of its ranking officers.  They've been planning to do this since the start of the war, and only sprung the trap now...  Any misgivings I had about the aggression associated with our new treatment are gone forever; we cannot be ferocious enough in purging these fiends from Maj'Eyal.  I have requested an audience with the Overseers to broaden the scope of our experiments, setting our sights higher so we may crush this evil empire as swiftly as possible.  \
\
May the Conclave prevail, and may the Empire's fate serve as a warning to all who would defy our wisdom.") -- _t

tDef(220, "The Overseers were ecstatic about my ideas!  Our staff have been relocated to a more secure location, deep underground with several extensive tunnels leading in from different locations.  Although this means we can no longer leave to harvest herbs for our infusions, the increased budget the Overseers have given us does more than enough to compensate.  Many wounded are still brought to me through the tunnels, but now our goal is not simply to make them as strong and healthy as they were before, but far stronger and far healthier than they could've dreamed.  They are brought to us unconscious, with amnesia spells already applied to ensure they do not resist our experiments; although they are not told they will be test subjects before being brought here, we are sure they would consent to these experiments, if they knew how valuable they were to help the Conclave.  As such, although this process violates several oaths we have taken as healers, I ultimately do not see any moral problem with this, and nobody else at this facility has expressed any concerns to me.  After all, those who join the Conclave as soldiers have already volunteered to give their lives in service to the Overseers' enlightened rule, and this is surely a much more productive way to do so than dying to a Nargol sling-bullet.\
\
With access to better components, we can make the same basic improvements to their strength as we could before, but the changes do not stop there!  With so many subjects to work with, and the Overseers' encouragement to take risks, we've made them much larger (with associated multiplying effects on their effectiveness in combat), and reinforced their constitution to be capable of bearing more inscriptions without collapsing under the stress.  A fellow researcher had the brilliant idea to use this runic affinity to both enhance their connection to magic's weave, and make them biologically and structurally dependent on it; now, our front-line soldiers can conjure devastating fireballs with little training, and should those hairy-footed vermin attempt to raise one of these soldiers from the dead, they will collapse, having lost the magic that kept them intact when they still lived.  \
\
The Overseers have been working with us personally to make psychological changes as well; with the blank slate provided by the amnesia spell, we've managed to give them a mindset that will serve them well both during the war and for our glorious reign that shall follow.  Extraordinarily dutiful, helpful and striving for excellence in their daily lives without lusting for power or personal glory, wise about their place in the world, and slow to anger...  but utterly ferocious when needed.  Just as the Higher were created to be scholars and policy-makers, and have proven successful in this role beyond the Conclave's wildest dreams, these new \"Ogres\" (as the staff has taken to nicknaming them) shall be our laborers and soldiers, a solid foundation of hard work and dutiful enforcement on which our society shall be built.  There will still be a place for the unaltered races, of course; their natural adaptability will make them perfect to fill in the gaps, as the glue that holds everything else together.\
\
These Ogres are integrating into our military very well!  The rank-and-file soldiers know better than to attract attention from the Overseers by asking too many questions about where their new, giant allies came from, and thus acceptance came rather swiftly once they saw these creations in action.  We received one report that an Ogre sergeant was seen eating a particularly insolent halfling alive, after he feigned surrender and attempted to cast a lightning spell; this spectacle was both highly motivating to our troops and demoralized the remnants of that halfling's squad into surrendering, so I shall be enhancing their digestive capabilities as well.  \
\
For the most part, though, our research work is done.  All that's left to do is get a response from the Overseers as to whether to increase their birth rate or not (currently set very low as a precaution against future overpopulation), and improve the training we give freshly-created Ogres for runic magic, given that regular maintenance of their runes is necessary to keep them alive.  This is not to say we have idle staff, however!  Some of us have made a project for after the war ends - a modification to our experimental growth-tanks, rendering them capable of holding a person of Ogric biology indefinitely in a \"sleeping\" state where they do not age or starve.  We can install tanks filled with these \"sleeping\" Ogres stationed near bridges that may need regular maintenance, stashed in reserve armories, or any other place where you'd need a batch of dependable workers or guards, without having to incur all the other costs associated with keeping extra citizens around.\

tDef(236, "Announcement to All Staff:\
\
I'm sure you've all heard the rumors about what our scryers saw, and why we've been on lockdown the past few days; it is with a heavy heart that I must confirm that they are true.  The Nargol have taken the land above our facility, and are combing the area with golems to find the entrances.  We've already lost one entrance to the failsafe explosive-rune traps set in place to collapse it, and now they'll be looking to defuse those as well.  In short, we have no means of escape, and if allowed the time, they will find the way in, kill us, and steal our precious work for themselves.  The Empire has been enough of a problem without Ogres; we CANNOT take the risk of them finding us and tipping the balance in their favor.\
\
We are doomed, no matter what happens.  My orders from the Overseers in such a situation would be to destroy our findings, then put an alchemical vial they gave me in the ventilation system, painlessly suffocating us.  I have no intention of throwing away our rightfully-earned place in the history books by doing this.  Instead, I have prematurely detonated all the remaining explosive traps, thoroughly sealing the way in.  We are very, very deep underground, and without any tunnels to follow, it could be decades before a Nargol excavation team reached us.  In other words, we are completely sealed off from the Nargol...  and the rest of the Conclave.\
\
We have a small supply of emergency rations, but it would last us a couple of months at the longest, and we cannot assume the Conclave will reclaim this territory in that time.  We could try to repurpose the infusion herb-garden for making edible crops, but that would only buy us a month after that before the grow-lights lost their magic.  Without drastic steps, we will surely die of starvation; fortunately, we have drastic steps available to us.\
\
This is my last order: I have prepared our surgical golems to apply the Ogric inscriptions to us, and updated all of our records to reflect our best current knowledge of their effects and effectiveness.  I have also had the golems upgrade all of our growth vats (ones in use included) to our newest \"stasis tank\" design, and furthermore freed up enough space for each of us to use one by...  disposing of some of the test subjects who had low chances of survival (an action I am already beginning to regret).  By the time you find this note, I will have already undergone this process myself, and will be hibernating in a tank I've had moved to my office.  If you do not wish to die, you should acquire a weapon from the armory, then follow my lead.  When we are dormant, we will be immune to the ravages of time, and prepared to greet whoever finally digs their way down and finds us.  Hopefully, it will be Conclave reinforcements, in which case we will stand down, give them our notes, and await further orders.  And if it isn't the Conclave...  make them regret it.  Send a message stronger than any NO TRESPASSING sign ever could, then resume your slumber.\
\
It has been an honor working with such talented individuals, and an honor doing everything I can for a noble cause.  Perhaps we still had some progress to make, but overall I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and the contributions the Ogre race will make to all of Maj'Eyal.  \

It still lies heavy on mine heart to think of what they could accomplish within our private circle. I but hope that one day they whilst return, and they whilst understand the reasons behind our solemn mission.\
\
But I must think of the future, for too many are the regrets of mine long past, and to hold their burdens overlong is to be crushed. I must think of ye, young acolytes, who start now in the learning of our lores. I must explain to ye our mission, our purpose, our justification, so that ye understand all what we do and why. In secrecy we operate, trying to heal the harms of our past, trying to build a better future. For our penance is great, and never should it be forgotten in all Eyal the terrors of the Spellblaze.\
\
I should know well, for I were there. But a young mage was I, though not without promise. I knew of the Shaloren mages' experiments on the Sher'Tul ruins. Aye, and I were jealous of the powers they sought to unlock. No fear or caution had I in my arrogant youth, thinking only of opportunities and glory. Heed well that thought...\
\
Two thousand six hundred cycles of the Sun have passed above my head, and yet still I cannot shake the memory of the day the sky turned to flame and the earth was torn to shreds. I felt the magic in the air, the sudden unleashing of arcane energies beyond anyone's control. I knew in an instant that the Shaloren had unlocked the power of the farportals, but the forces were far beyond their expectations. I saw within seconds the streams of blazing energy tear through the sky above our heads, and then rain down in crimson plumes of destruction. It was all I could to put a shield about myself, and the burns I suffered were terrible, such that scars remain to this day. No one about me survived. Still I remember mine sister Neira's shortened scream as she stood beside me, her skin flayed off by the terrible energies, her body consumed by a pyre of flames, her ashes strewn by a great tumult in the earth. Twenty-six centuries have passed and still I do wake to the sound of that scream...\
\
Many were the loved ones I lost that day, and I were not alone. Countless perished across the lands, and countless more died in the chaos which followed. Then the Spellhunt began, and the people rose against the arrogance of the mages and began slaughtering us mercilessly. After the Spellblaze our abilities were in disarray, our mana channels sundered. We were nigh defenceless, and it took great effort to gather many of us together and found the hidden city of Angolwen. A great many mages were killed in the riots that followed, aye and many innocents too, for distrust was rife and the thirst for blood all-consuming. But alas, the suffering did not end there.\
\
The effects of the Spellblaze can still be seen today, in tortured lands and blighted earths. In the Age of Dusk it were much worse. New diseases arose, plagues swept across all cities, civilisations brought to nothing. All our races came close to extinction, and an age of darkness came upon all learning and enlightenment. Feudal lords and bandit gangs fought amongst what little healthy lands were left, whilst the blights continued to ravage what free people remained. That was when I did begin our secret missions to repair the world, to make right the errors of our actions. In silent operation we visited the broken lands and used our powers to heal, not to destroy. Many centuries it took, but at last the aftereffects of the Spellblaze began to diminish, and the people began to rebuild.\
\
Ah, how much hope was in me then. But foolish were I to think it could be so easy. The wounds of Eyal struck deeper than mere diseases on the surface. The poison went down much further, and the cracks tore through the very roots of our world. One dark and stormy day a great cataclysm swept forth from the east, and the land rose 500 leagues into the sky. We could do naught but gasp in horror as whole cities, whole races were swept into the sea. The continents were sheared apart and all of Eyal forever changed. It was a sight to humble even the greatest archmage.\
\
Aye, and humility is what I teach to ye now. Know ye well that there are forces out there which dwarf ye into insignificance. Know as well that they have no glory, no pride, for they are forces of ultimate destruction which bring only terror and pain.\
\
Our mission is to help the world. Our penance is to act in secret. Old wounds remain and new threats do arise, but all must be dealt with from behind our cloak of silence. The mistrust of our ilk still lies deep in people's minds, and there are even those who hate us with a violent passion. But the world is changing, and perhaps one day we shall be accepted again in society. Until then remember well this lesson of humility, and in the open world keep ye secret, and keep ye safe.") -- _t

#{italic}#A study by Archmage Tazimar Tarelion#{normal}#\
\
How uncouth and common a question it must seem, and yet it is the one I am asked most often, even by some of our most learned students. Too often we teach The Art by practice and imitation and concentration on the end effects, without teaching in greater detail of the underlying principles. Just as a musician may merrily play on his harp without knowing how the sound arises from the vibration of the strings, so a mage may make use of magic without realising the true forces at work. In this document I hope to give learning on the nature of magic, and how the underlying effects give rise to all the wondrous fruits we can produce.\
\
Alchemists will tell you that the world is made up of many base materials - lead, copper, iron, gold and so on. They are fixated on splitting things down into these components and investigating how they react with each other. However there is more to the world than this. Certainly they represent the physical make-up of things, but they do not show the forces and energy that bring everything into motion. The forces of fire, cold, lightning and life itself are all very real effects, and these we call the Elements of Eyal. The true archmage is interested in the interactions of the elemental forces of the world, and manipulating them to his or her need.\
\
The elemental forces exist naturally in the world, and are weaved around all things in an all-encompassing canvas. They move, vibrate and resonate with the materials of the world, and the effects of each play heavily on one another. All creatures naturally make use of these elements, and some are more attuned to these threads than others. With great training and practice we can become more attuned to these wild forces ourselves, and in so doing some can match the speed of wolves, the strength of bears, the tenacity of treants and even the immense natural powers of dragons.\
\
But there is another way of gaining access to these elemental forces - a more direct way, though some would call it unnatural. Long ago people discovered with much training how to concentrate their wills to pluck the elemental threads directly. This can release great energies, and these can be shaped to produce real effects in the world. Plumes of fire, bolts of lightning and blasts of ice can all be called forth by those suitably trained. The true masters of magic can go much further, combining many resonant forces to create complex physical effects.\
\
The tapping of threads can be a draining task, requiring much effort of will to sustain. This is what we versed in the arcane call \"mana\", that mental stamina dedicated to the interaction with the elements of the world. Continual use of magic is like the constant lifting and holding of heavy weights, and eventually one will find one's capacity drained. Practice allows one to build up greater pools of mana, and certain runes and spells can gradually build extra reserves to be called upon as needed.\
\
Magical runes and items are imbued with an attachment to certain elemental threads. This requires delicate work by experienced and gifted enchanters. The most intricate of magical artifacts demand many years of work, using intense mental effort to permanently attune the core materials to the right elemental energies. Gemstones are especially easy to work with in this craft, and alchemists use them often to bring about elemental effects.\
\
Some believe that magic is inherently wrong, that the so-called twisting of the elements with one's will can only lead to terrible things. As students of Angolwen I assume you disagree! Magic is simply an extension of the forces of nature, and are we not natural creatures that use it? But remember that magic is still a powerful force that can be used for good or ill. Magic is indeed a tool of immense value - use it wisely.\

Another day dawns on Angolwen. I hesitate to write this, but it almost feels as if peace is once again returning to Eyal.

Regardless, my sleep grows less disturbed by my memories of the Spellhunt day by day, and I can now devote myself wholly to the betterment of our cloistered community here in the mountains.\

This is not to say that life has been without conflict at all. An agent of the Ziguranth infiltrated Angolwen under the guise of a travelling alchemist a few days ago; an unhappy first, I'm afraid. Having used choking powder to incapacitate the guards and rob the surrounding mages of their voices, things may have turned ugly if Linaniil hadn't been passing by on one of her walks.

It's been some time since High Sun Paladin Aeryn sent me out on an assignment. According to recent intelligence, it would seem that a cavern has mysteriously emerged near our outpost, the Gates of Morning. They have bestowed the name \"Ardhungol\" on the newly discovered cavern. The elder warriors seem anxious in regards to the origin of this new subterranean area; they're likely concerned that the orcs are using Ardhungol as a staging point for further aggression against the Gates of Morning. I'll have to make sure I'm well equipped for this journey; the fate of us all could hang in the balance.\
\
#{bold}#Journal Entry II#{normal}#\
\
I spoke with the border patrols tonight. There seem to have been several sightings of orcs and other wild beasts roaming throughout the wilderness, yet strangely enough, none seem to have been anywhere near Ardhungol. Perhaps the subterranean cavern was simply a natural phenomenon with unfortunate timing. It's either that, or an unknown force powerful enough to alter the very foundation of the land upon its arrival. I shudder at the latter thought, but for now this is all merely speculation. If all goes well, I'll be ready to depart by dawn.\

It was a half days journey from the Gates of Morning to Ardhungol, but I've finally arrived. I've decided to rest beneath the shade of a great oak tree and enjoy one of the sweet rolls my wife Melnela prepared for me. I'm unsure why, but the closer I've come to Ardhungol, the thicker the atmosphere has become, almost as if there is a foreign energy infecting the very air I breathe. I've been to many places in this vast world, but I've never felt an aura quite like this; I will have to uncover the source of this energy before I can bring a full report back to Aeryn.\

A thick green veil of mist permeates the air within this cavern; I'm uncertain if this is a byproduct of whatever creatures now inhabit this place, or if it's coming directly from another source.

I have slain dozens of these arachnids, each one seemingly more difficult than the last.

I don't see how that could be possible however, a mere spider couldn't possibly adapt to the battle techniques of a veteran Sun Paladin, it's simply not feasible. Furthermore, the origin of these spiders worries me. So far I have not found any other entrances to this cavern, meaning they were transported here via other means. Those arcane rifts I found earlier are starting to worry me, and I fear for us all when I think of what may be waiting for us beyond them. I must put these thoughts out of my mind; distractions will only serve to weaken my resolve.\

I know you wished to honour your people by defeating me and destroying my tower, but I'm sure you realise now that it was a rather vain endeavour.\
\
I apologise for what happened to that lovely suit of plate. I know it got a little... worn... during the treatment. But I'm afraid I really did need to find out the locations of your companion, and certain pressures had to be applied. You weren't very talkative, now were you? But I soon made you sing, oh yes. Of course, I could have just used a little divination magic to find out what I wanted, but I do so enjoy a good torture... And my, how joyous your screams were whenever the acid splashed against your beard! Hoh, we did chortle, did we not? But no matter, I've had my best skeletal smiths work on fixing your armour, fit to be worn by my new champion.\

I hope you enjoy your new work. Approach it with gusto, that sort of thing. I know in life you always dreamed of being a mighty hero of legend. But, well, what can be more glorious than this? You will live forever as my servant, destined to defend my throne for all time! You will be the envy of all the lesser ghouls that shamble about my halls. Well, until you get slain by some dumb intruding adventurer, of course... But that's the beauty of you heroes - one comes in, makes a mess, and then I get a new plaything to toy with.

tDef(27, "#{italic}#From the memoirs of Aranion Gawaeil, leader of the Grand Council of Elvala#{normal}#\
\
#{bold}#Chapter One: A Fateful Meeting#{normal}#\
\
This tale begins in the Age of Allure, when I was yet young, and the idea of youth and age was still a pressure on our people.  It is one tale amongst a host of tales, for many are the stories of tragedy and heroism that befell all the races in this era.  I can only give my story, my tragedies, and my follies dressed as heroism, woven around the great force that shook our world and changed our histories: The Spellblaze.\
\
I first met Linaniil at a council summit, when our leader Ephinias was meeting with the head of the Kar’Krul.  I remember the huge man walking through the gates of our city, our people staring at his wide girth and bristling hair, his fur clothes and his proud stride.  How out of place he looked amongst us slender elves...  Some thought him a barbarian, but I could see behind his frosty eyes there was great power.  He was from a hardy race of men that once dwelt in the north of Eyal, who it was said drew power from the green fires that danced in their everwinter skies.  Turthel was his name, and the like of him has not trod through earth or snow in many centuries.  Upon his right hand he wore the Ring of Kar’Krul, a lustrous gold band adorned by a blazing ruby, token to his position as the leader of the greatest union of human mages in Maj’Eyal.\
\
With him were his twin daughters, Linaniil and Neira, who walked before him.  Identical they were in looks, yet I saw straight away that they were opposites in personality.  They were each of crimson hair, worn long in spilling tresses, with pale skin that shone in the sunlight.  They were dressed in silken robes, but whilst Neira was adorned in yellow and orange, Linaniil wore blue and silver.  Neira was bright of glance and cheery of voice, remarking on every item of beauty she passed as they strolled through the courtyards of Elvala.  Linaniil was quiet though, and stern of face, coldly analysing and calculating all she saw.  But beneath that icy exterior I could see a fire – nay, a blaze, a bright burning passion yearning to break out, yet kept restrained.  For a moment we made eye contact as the party approached the citadel, and I could see laid bare her wild spirit and untempered thoughts, a will and strength of mind that was utterly unconquerable.  It took my breath from me.\
\
Few of my people have ever understood how one of our race could be infatuated with a human.  But they have not known Linaniil.  Not as I have known her.  Like raw fire given flesh is she, a burning ball of emotions and desires.  Her fervent mind brooks no opposition, and her wit and words charm or coerce all around her.  Beautiful and radiant is her form, as bright as the summer sun, yet also cold and remote, unreachable unless she wants to be reached.  In all the ages this has never changed about her.\
\
I barely noticed Neira greeting me warmly as she passed through the gate.  Linaniil gave me but a curt nod.  I followed after, as our leader and his guests entered the grand chamber and took their seats.  The summit was to begin on the planning of a new endeavour, a great work by our highest mages to tap into the power of the Sher’Tul farportals.  Long had the relics of that ancient race lain dormant beneath the soil, their powers untouched.  With that mighty strength brought forth we could end the war with the orcs quickly and decisively.  The Spellblaze they called it, and it was a name we spoke in awe and reverence.\
\
King Ephinias began the meeting, introducing our guests and then those around him.  “This is my general,” he said gesturing to me, “Commander Gawaeil of the Shaloren Armies.”  Immediately Linaniil looked at me and gawked.\
\
“What?” she cried, staring at my armour and baldric.  She turned away from us, seeming not to heed her distinguished hosts.  “Father, what be the meaning of this?” she said to the burly man.  “Ye gave tell that the Shaloren had the mightiest battlemages, yet their general be cased in steel and girt with sword.  Does a mere fighter command experts in the Art?”\
\
Ephinias looked outraged, but I laughed suddenly, both at her extreme rudeness and her wild presumptions.  “A mere fighter?” I said between incredulous gasps.  “Lady, you would do well not to judge so on appearances.  For if I judge right I see no mere impudent lass before me, but a great master of flames and inflagrations, and a weaver of threads more stern-willed even than her chill-blooded father.  But do not presume yourself a greater worker of the Art than I!  For I am Aranion Gawaeil, master of the Arcane Blade, a channeller of mighty elemental forces.  The spells willed through my steel have slain more orcs than you have seen in your short life, or like will ever see.”\
\
She looked at me then with sudden interest.  “A strange technique it sounds.  Ludicrous it seems when one can simply burn foes from afar.  Though perhaps if we hunt orc together some time I shall see for mine self.  But ye would be hard pressed indeed to better me on the battlefield.”\
\
“I shall endeavour to impress, my lady,” I said, with a mock bow of my head.  A thin smile played across her lips.\
\
Turthel grunted and turned his shaggy head to the king.  “Business,” he said, in the blunt and brief manner I had heard reported of him.\
\
Ephinias cleared his throat and sat back in his chair.  “We have a grand plan before us,” he began. “For many years we have been plagued by orc attacks.  Initially we were weakened from the Allure Wars, but now that we are beginning to recover our strength it is time to put our joint enemy to rest.  Too often they have threatened to overrun us all, to destroy civilisation forever.  We have all lost much.  Turthel, I can deeply sympathise with your personal loss.”  The fur-clothed man did not change his expression, but I could see his daughters dip their heads in solemn thought.\
\
“I have been leading our archmages in an experiment on the Sher’Tul farportal to the east of here.  We believe we can evoke the great powers sealed within to create a wave of destructive energy that we could direct against the orcish armies.  If all the races cooperate in drawing the orcish forces out then we can end this war in one swift strike.  The orcs would be decimated beyond recovery, and Eyal would be cleansed of their presence.\
\
“I have approached the leaders of the other races.  The halflings are fully supportive.  The Nargol regents have even provided us with some of their historical research on Sher’Tul ruins.”\
\
Turthel cursed then suddenly.  “Research done on human slaves!” he barked.  He turned quiet then, letting his temper settle.  “What of your sea and forest cousins?”\
\
Ephinias looked him coolly in the eye.  “The Naloren are prideful and do not wish to cooperate.  They think they can protect their lands on their own.  Yet I believe they will thank us in the end...  The Thaloren are not entirely keen either.  But we have discussed with their king and queen, and given great assurances as to the safety of our operations.  They do not wholly trust us or our command of the arcane, but in this they will not oppose us.  Shatur is as weary of the orc attacks on its borders as any of us.  They will give aid where it is convenient, as long as they ride under their own banners.  We do not particularly need them, of course, but we thought it prudent to involve all we could.\
\
“The other human leaders have mostly assented.  Some have expressed wholly irrational fears of our activities.  Alas, legends and myths still abound to scare people away from anything to do with the Sher’Tul.  But we are confident that we know what we are doing here.  The Kar’Krul elite I’m sure will understand.  And your alliance is worth a dozen lesser kings.”\
\
The burly man stared hard and long into Ephinias’ eyes, before turning to his daughters.  “What do ye think, girls?”\
\
Neira was the first to respond, and there was colour in her cheeks and emotion in her voice.  “I deem this Shaloren king remote and proud.  Sympathy he talks of whilst using our mother’s memory as a tool.  Understanding he proclaims, yet how can any truly know the subtlety behind these Sher’Tul relics?  Untouched they be for millennia, and their original power is still unknown.  What pride lets ye think ye can toy with them now?  It be folly to use a weapon that ye know not how to wield.”\
\
The room went quiet, and I could see Ephinias was silently fuming.  He was not accustomed to such open criticism.  Then Linaniil began to speak, and her voice was low and cool, yet all ears hung on her words.  “Many have been the works of pride over the years that have arisen in splendour.  Whence have come our great artworks, our grand cities, or the arcane weavings that shape our societies?  No meekness be found in their crafting.  There be no shame in acting out of pride, and we gain nothing from misplaced humility.  Too long have the powers of the Sher’Tul been left untapped by fearful and timid hearts.”  I could see then her eyes light up with excitement.  “Think of the glories we could unlock!  This war with the orcs would be but the beginning.  Great benefit could be brought to us all.  To leave these powers buried would be a crime, I say.”\
\
Turthel paused reflectively before nodding his head slowly, and it was clear that Linaniil’s words aligned better with his own thoughts.  “Very well,” he slowly announced, looking directly at Ephinias.  “We are with you.”  Neira stayed silent with brooding concern, but a flash of satisfaction crossed her sister’s eyes.") -- _t

\
It was three nights later I awoke in darkness from a troubled dream to find my window open, the silk drapes billowing in the breeze.  As my eyes adjusted to the light I saw Linaniil stood at the foot of my bed, a thin azure dress clinging to her skin in the chill night air.  Around her was a cashmere belt inset with opals and woven with pale runes, and gold jewellery adorned her neck and wrists.  A long staff rested lightly in her hands, rubies glistening in its decorated top.  Her red hair stirred in the wind as she gazed at me.\
 \
“What are you doing here?” I enquired.  I did not bother asking how she managed to sneak into my bedchamber, past many guards.  I knew that no less than a council member would be able to divine her presence when she put her mind to illusion.\
 \
She looked at me slowly for a moment, before turning her eyes to the rest of the room, analysing my personal space in detail.  “There be a band of orcs marauding in the north,” she said in a distracted tone.  She picked an ornamental dagger from a shelf and looked it over as she spoke.  “They look like to cause trouble for some outlying elven settlements.”\
 \
“I will summon a raiding party at once,” I said, rising quickly from my bed, unheeding of modesty.\
 \
“Oh, how boring!” she complained, putting the dagger down and spinning to face me.  “What of the promise ye made to hunt orc together?”\
 \
“What, just the two of us?”\
 \
“Aye,” she said, looking my unclad form up and down with a slow gaze, seeming to take delight in the sight.  “Or are ye not man enough?”\
 \
“A strange question to ask of an elf, my lady.  But I can take this band of orcs myself, I am sure.  If you wish to tag along then I cannot promise to keep you safe.”\
 \
She laughed then, and the sound was like ringing crystal.  “Very well then!  Get ye your steel stick and we shall see who holds their own best.”  I agreed with a smile, and went to my armoury and shoved on metal greaves and a chain hauberk, my breastplate and steel gauntlets.  Linaniil tutted in surly impatience.  “Must ye wear that tin suit?”\
 \
“It is my battle gear,” said I, pulling on my visored helm and wrapping a thick cloak round my shoulders.\
 \
“Ye look like a golem,” she muttered, visibly annoyed.  “Come then, I grow bored.”  She leapt out the window, taking to the air with grace, flying away into the night.\
 \
I took then my greatsword from its hanging.  It was a simple looking blade, adorned only with a heavy moonstone on its pommel.  But its looks belied its power, for it was forged by the dwarves in their early years, before vanity overcame their works and their weapons became more for show than for battle.  It had an edge that clove through steel and bone with ease, without ever dulling the blade.  Mooncutter it is called, though it is lost to me now.  I gave it a swing through the air before leaping out the window myself, conjuring a cushion of air beneath me and following swiftly after Linaniil.\
 \
With rapid pace we flew through the scattered clouds in silence for twenty minutes before Linaniil began to descend.  I could see nestled between some low hills were the flames of campfires, and as we came closer the sound of orcish chanting became clear.  “How shall we approach them?” I called out, wondering what tactics the sorceress would want to employ.\
 \
“Directly,” she said, and with that she made a sudden burst of speed, coming right above the orcish camp and descending in their midst.  With a curse I sped after her, landing by her side and drawing Mooncutter as the orcs rose in fury and alarm, grabbing up their weapons.  As a ring of dark swords and spears and halberds gathered round us Linaniil turned to me with a wild smile.  “Time to dance.”\
 \
She shot forth a ray of purple arcane energy from her right hand, whilst her left held up her staff, its tip blazing like a torch.  Flames leapt up in tandem from my own blade as I rose it high, and swept it before me in a wide arc, cutting down the nearest brute and sending a shocking wave of fire into the troops behind it.  I pressed forward, forcing back the orcs before me with a roaring hot wind.  Their weapons dropped from their hands as they reached up to cover their faces, and with a grin of satisfaction I rushed to hew their heads off.  But as I swung my blade I was knocked to the ground from behind by a blast of fire, and turning about I saw Linaniil standing in a pillar of flame, her arms outstretched as it expanded around her.  “Too hot for ye, Aranion?” she called out as the orcs nearby were fried to a crisp, their flesh withering into black dust.\
 \
I grunted, and turned my blade into ice, and with deft sword strokes sent streams of freezing cold into the orcs around her, so that they shattered like glass before the fire ever hit them.  Linaniil cursed my name as she dropped the flames from about her.  “Don’t ruin my fun!” she exclaimed, before teleporting to the other side of the camp and beginning to blast the orcs there.\
\
I laughed and turned on the beasts nearest me, and brought tumults to the earth with each swing, so that they lost their footing and fell to the ground before my sword found their throats.  Then I conjured a mighty spark of lightning, spearing it through their densest ranks, and I rushed along its glowing length hewing down the monsters before they could react.  I laughed again with the fey heat of battle, and I discarded my helm and tore off my platemail, taking joy from moving about the field with ease and slaughtering my inferior foes.  Mooncutter danced through their flesh, and their dark blood gushed and fountained with joyful rhythm.\
\
On the far side of the camp explosions and screams marked Linaniil’s passage, and I saw burning limbs flying into the air and streaks of fire tearing through the night.  The sorceress was wreathed in flames, her eyes shining, and the dancing blaze about her made her look like a nymph of fire incarnate.  No more beautiful and awe-inspiring a sight had I ever beheld.\
\
Seeing their numbers quickly dwindling the orcs began to flee, but I phased to block their retreat and called forth a wave of water, forcing them back against Linaniil’s flames.  There against the wall of fire I dashed them, and great numbers of them fell like leaves scattered in the wind.  Blood spilled thick and plentiful, and with but a few more thrusts of Mooncutter and blasts from Linaniil’s hands the battle was over.  Not a single orc still moved, and well over four hundred lay dead on the ground.\
 \
Linaniil and I stood facing each other, panting with sudden exhaustion as the adrenaline of the fight left us.  “I lost count,” I said between breaths, “of who slew more…”  She grinned coyly at me, sweat trickling down her face.  Minor cuts and burns left her robe in tatters, with one shoulder strap hanging loose.  Her glistening chest heaved up and down with each breath, and her deep eyes looked at me with naked intensity.\
 \
She strode forward then, and grabbing me roughly by my hauberk she pulled my lips to hers.  The kiss was hot and fierce, and as she bit my lower lip the course of blood in battle came back to me afresh.  I kissed her again and grabbed her body, pulling her tight to me, our lips locked.  She tore lustfully at my remaining armour, flinging it to the ground, and I slid off her silken clothes, till we were left bare beneath the stars.  Then against a rocky outcrop we pressed against each other, still gasping and sweating from the fight.  There with blazing passion flesh met flesh and our hot moans rose into the cold night sky.") -- _t

\
“Why are ye not leader?” asked Linaniil, resting her head in her hand with her naked form strewn across my bed.\
 \
I looked at her, surprised by the sudden question.  My mind struggled briefly with the strange query, still recovering from the heat of sex but a minute before.  “Why should I be leader?” I asked back.\
 \
“Because ye are strong, of course,” she responded.  “I deem ye stronger in battle than any of your kin.  Ye should rule with such strength.”\
 \
I chuckled softly.  “Mere strength is not enough to rule a people.  It requires responsibilities, careful decision making, and above all – politics.  I have no interest in such matters.  Ephinias is far better suited to those sorts of things.  Give me a sword and soldiers to lead into battle and I am content.  Let the leaders worry about where I should point my blade.”\
\
She was quiet a moment, seemingly dissatisfied with that response.  “Ye are not happy with the current plans though.”\
\
For a moment I was struck with shock.  It surprised me how clearly she divined my inner thoughts.  I had not expressed my concerns to anyone, yet she could so easily read me.  Five weeks it had been since we first met, and it seemed like there was nothing I could hide from her keen sight.\
 \
The preparations for the Spellblaze were well underway.  Turthel of the Kar’Krul had returned to his northern citadel, but he left his daughters as ambassadors to aid in our designs.  It meant Linaniil and I had many an opportunity to meet, though we kept it secret.  Few of my race would understand or approve of such a liaison, and none of us could afford a scandal. Yet I could not resist this human mage’s advancements, nor she mine.\
 \
“I am a warrior,” I said to her finally, getting brusquely from my bed and recovering my robes.  “I settle my battles facing my foe, not by toying with relics from afar.  It irks me that we must deal with our enemies in such a craven way.”\
\
“But does it not excite ye, using these Sher’Tul ruins?” she said, putting a finger to her lower lip as she still languished in my bed, the sheets sticking tightly to her bare skin.  She seemed visibly aroused by her thoughts.  “Such powers lain dormant for so long, ready to be summoned to our control...  How it were I to command so great a venture!”\
\
I shook my head sadly as I finished buttoning up my doublet.  “I do not trust those ruins.  We Shaloren are mighty, but we have yet to reach the heights of the Sher’Tul, nor do we truly understand the devices they have left behind.  My thoughts are more with your sister Neira on this.  We should stick to what abilities we have mastered, without stretching ourselves to such grand experimentation.”\
 \
Linaniil looked at me intently, a touch of humour in her dark eyes.  “If ye were leader then ye could stop this.  But then I would have to hate ye.”\
 \
I allowed myself a thin smile.  “Well, that would indeed be a terrible and dangerous thing.”  I finished dressing whilst Linaniil still lay in my bed, her face reflective.  “I must go now to check on the latest operations at the farportal.  You are welcome to join me.”\
 \
She shook her head languidly.  “Nay, I wish to rest more.  And besides, hearing their reports would but make me jealous.  Leave me here awhile – I wilst depart in secret later.”\
 \
I left my chamber then, dark thoughts now brooding at the back of my mind.  The date was coming closer when our plans would come to fruition and the Great Spellblaze would be unleashed.  A heavy foreboding lay over my heart.  Yet the alternatives seemed grim.  The war with the orcs was going badly, with few races able to secure their borders well and attacks from the brutes ever increasing.  Their numbers seemed inexhaustible.  Though they had little skill in warfare they could bring great harm to unprotected townsteads, and in enough force could bring down cities.  One human kingdom had collapsed under their attacks but a week before.  After that many who had initially rejected our plans came begging for our protection.  The Spellblaze seemed our only hope against imminent disaster.\
 \
Such thoughts were weighing on my mind as I passed from my chambers in the palace, down to the courtyard by the main gate.  Then from the corner of my eye I saw a swish of long red hair, and spun round thinking Linaniil had followed me.  But the golden robes and bright eyes of Neira revealed otherwise.\
 \
“Expecting someone else?” she asked with a wide smile, seeing the surprised look on my face.\
 \
“I was deep in thought,” I explained, bowing slightly to greet her.  “I am just on my way to inspect the farportal operations.  Perhaps you-“\
 \
“I shall join ye,” she said quickly, not waiting for my invitation.  I nodded my assent and guided her to my carriage.\
 \
As soon as we took off east the mood changed.  “She wilst only hurt ye,” said Neira suddenly.\
 \
I cursed quietly, understanding her meaning.  “Are there no secrets to be had in all Eyal?” I muttered.\
 \
“Not between sisters, and especially not between twins.”  She smiled warmly at me, yet there was no humour in her eyes.  “I mean it though.  I love mine sister, but I know her ways.  She be fickle, and willed to do her own thing when she likes.  Do not be surprised when she bores of ye.  Nor hurt.”\
 \
“I am quite capable of taking care of myself,” I said in clipped tone.\
 \
She gazed into my eyes a moment and then turned away to stare out the window.  “Well, I have warned ye...” she replied softly, a touch of sadness in her voice.\
 \
Was it jealousy perhaps that stirred such an outburst?  And for her sister’s attention or for mine?  I never did discover.  The rest of the trip was spent in sullen silence.  The sun was setting behind our carriage, casting a long shadow on the path ahead, and bathing the land about in crimson light.  It seemed for a moment like we rode into some demon’s plane, pitch black shadows melting into blood-red soil, whilst cold white stars began to spear through the sky above.  I shivered suddenly as the ruins came into view.\
 \
Few Sher’Tul ruins have been discovered which even come close to matching the grandeur of those which were near Elvala.  Many centuries our people spent excavating them, digging deep into the ground, ever careful not to damage or upset the relics.  The centrepiece was the Crystal Tower.  From the surface all that could be seen of it was a wide, even-sided square, which when cleaned of soil revealed a white stone smoother than marble.  But delving down our archaeologists found it plummeted deep, deep below the ground.  Half a mile it went down, the featureless white stone not bearing a single mark or engraving anywhere on its surface, until it ended suddenly and without foundation.  It was like the whole tower was separate from the earth, some strange thing of the stars that had dropped from the skies and lay sleeping beneath the soil.\
 \
Some years earlier our people had solved the invisible runes that allowed it to be opened, revealing vast crystal-lined halls and chambers arrayed in geometric patterns of sublime beauty.  Light sparked and shone from every surface, and the walls seemed to hum with energy.  Many shafts and passageways could only be navigated by flight, and at the top was found a grand room large enough to encompass the whole palace of Elvala.  At its centre was the farportal, a raised dais forty feet in diameter and crackling with energy upon which slowly spun a cloud of stars.  It was beautiful and frightening, enchanting and terrifying.  No power of the Shaloren could discern its operation, and though through careful experimentation we were able to manipulate its energies, never could we get a true grasp of the forces that lay beneath.\
\
Neira and I descended to the base of the tower, smothered in the cold shadows of the excavated ruins.  I nodded to the guards as we passed through the square white entrance, and Neira’s eyes instantly enlarged in wonder.  The scintillating rooms were eye-catching to be sure, but they were also desolate and empty.  I tried to imagine what it must have looked like when filled with Sher’Tul.  “How did they all die?” I asked under my breath as we traversed the crystal halls, a question many had asked before.\
 \
The sorceress picked up on my words and laughed softly.  “It be a mystery, of course!  Mine mother once taught me that they killed themselves in a great civil war, using magics far beyond our imaginings.”\
 \
“I wonder,” said I.  We had our own records, of course, which we didn’t share with the younger races, but they were not so clear-cut as the many myths that had spread over the ages.\
 \
We reached the central shaft, and from there levitated up past floors and floors of abandoned chambers, living spaces, workshops, storerooms, and many other areas of purpose undivined by our loremasters.  Finally, after ascending for several minutes, we rose into the grand chamber of the farportal, and Neira gasped to see its size.  Her eyes soon settled on the great Sher’Tul farportal, sparks from it reflecting off the roof hundreds of feet above.  About it were bustling many of our Shaloren mages in silken robes, and Ephinias himself was leading the operations.\
 \
He broke from his advisers as he saw us arrive, and strode towards us with a confident smile on his face.  Though he wore the grey robes of a research mage he still bore his great golden staff, Luminis, token of his position as king.\
 \
“Ah, General Aranion!” he said, “You have come at last.  And brought the Kar’Krul girl with you; how splendid.”\
 \
I gave a small bow.  “Your majesty.  I am here for the update on our operations.”\
 \
“Yes, yes, of course,” he said with a dismissive hand gesture.  “And doubtless the girl is here to make sure we know what we’re doing?”\
 \
If Neira was offended she covered it up well.  “It would be mine delight to see evidence of ye skill and power over the ruins, lord Ephinias.”\
 \
The king smiled and nodded then, and called to some of his aides.  “Prepare the topography demonstration, using the acute fire strand.”  He turned back to us then.  “It is not mere skill and power of course that we can show you, but subtlety and scale too.  Now excuse me a moment whilst I join the others.”\
 \
He went with two of the senior research mages then to the front of the farportal.  They faced each other and began a low humming in unison, and slowly it seemed that the sparks from the farportal began to flicker redly.  Over the course of a few minutes their hum became a higher pitched chant, but softly sung and still in perfect unison.  As they raised their staffs there appeared above the farportal an image in flames, and looking at it both Neira and I marvelled, for we could see clearly that it was an image of ourselves, looking upwards, as if looking we were staring into a mirror.  Our features and movements were all clearly discernible, down the smallest detail, all carved out of flickering orange fire.\
 \
Then the chanting rose higher and it seemed the image zoomed out, so that we saw the farportal nearby us and the mages gathered about.  And still the focus soared upwards till we were but specks in a wide hall, until the image was displaced by a white square with carven edges dug into the earth about it, and I knew we were looking at the top of the Crystal Tower from above.  The view widened, and I could see the land rushing away, and the city of Elvala to the west.  The chanting rose higher and now the sea could be seen, and the mountains to the north-west, and all the land about.  And soon the continent was visible, right to the frozen north, and the ocean wrapped all about, and it seemed small white stars were dotted about the landscape.  The singing reached a crescendo and before us hung an image of the whole of Eyal, a globe of fire suspended in mid-air, slowly turning.\
 \
Then the chanting stopped and the image disappeared, and I could hear beside me Neira suddenly gasp for air, as if she had not dared draw breath through the last few minutes.\
 \
“You see now?” said Ephinias, grinning with pleasure.  “From the smallest detail to the grandest scale we can manipulate the farportal’s energy.  And did you see those white points marked across the image?  They are the other farportals spread across the world, and this one can connect to them all.  With careful, delicate control we can harmonise the energy of them all and use it to our will.  I’m afraid your sword can be no match to this, Aranion.”\
 \
I had no words to respond, and only nodded softly, still in awe of what I had seen.  Neira seemed the same, and I could see her now staring at the farportal with the same eager eyes as her sister.  She was converted.\
 \
Yet my hand strayed across the hilt of Mooncutter, and my heart still murmured with unease.") -- _t

\
I rode my great grey horse at a low trot, surrounded by my lieutenants and their elite cavalry and spellrangers.  Beside me on a brown mare my squire held high a banner emblazoned with a flame-wreathed sword, symbol of my personal entourage.  The pole seemed to shiver slightly in the young elf’s hands, a sign of nervousness.\
 \
“Hold that banner firm, boy,” I said in a commanding tone.\
 \
The squire suddenly sat upright in his saddle, and gripped tight on the banner pole.  “Yes, sire!” he said, alarmed.  “Whatever you say, sire!”  He kept his head faced forward but I could see his eyes glance towards me, desperate for approval.  Whatever I say indeed...  I had seen his gaze on me before, with all the adoration of a young soldier towards his commander, and perhaps a little more.  If I had not the joy of Linaniil’s company then the attention of such a pretty lad would not be unwelcome.  But this was not the time for such thoughts.\
 \
This would be the day, the day of the Spellblaze, and the boy had every right to be nervous.  It was a few hours after midnight, and already our scouts would be engaged alongside the other races, drawing out the orcs from their hiding places.  We marched through our main offensive lines, where we would hem them in before the great conflagration.  All around were arrayed spears and swords and mail, glistening in the starlight.  Troops upon troops of battlemages in purple robes held aloft glowing staves.  It was a sight to behold.  Yet we knew also the risk of engaging on open ground with the orcs in their full numbers.  If the Spellblaze failed then we would suffer greatly.\
\
I set up camp upon a low hill overlooking the field, and then left my entourage to seek the Kar’Krul army to the north.  As I rode my stallion towards their station I could see smoke rising in the east.  Four thick grey plumes stood out against the pre-dawn light.  They would be villages looted and burned by the orcs as they rampaged against our feigned assaults.  The townsteads would be empty, but after this battle there would be nothing left for their residents to return to.  A small sacrifice in a game of war that spanned the continent.\
\
A fifth column of smoke began to rise, and in the greenish haze of early morn those pillars of smoke suddenly seemed to look like a demonic hand stretching over the world, ready to dig its claws into the earth and rip out the flesh beneath.  This, I knew, was the threat the orcs faced to us all, a menace to all civilisation.  Whatever price we paid to stop them would be a small one.  So I thought.  So we all thought.\
 \
When I reached the Kar’Krul camp Linaniil came out to meet me.  Her smile was warm at the sight of me, but I could tell from her eyes that she was more excited for the events of the day.  “Just a few more hours,” she whispered like an impatient child.  “This will be fascinating!”\
 \
As I came in the Kar’Krul pavilion I saw Neira inside, and some of their senior mages and delegates from other human kingdoms.  I knew Turthel would not be with them, as he stayed in his northern city with his people.  It was not cowardice nor age that held him back from the front lines of war.  Indeed, it was said that ever since his wife was killed by the orcs he had to restrain himself from battle, lest his anger overcome him and he destroy friend and foe alike in his rage.  Yet it was known that sometimes he would venture through the lands alone, and he would bring with him a deafening storm of wrath, and the orcs would cower at the rumour of the approach of Turthel, Tempest of the North.\
 \
Neira and Linaniil commanded the Kar’Krul forces, and from the firm-set look on their archmages’ faces it was clear that they were ready for whatever the day would bring.  Yet Neira looked troubled, doubt evident in her eyes.\
 \
“What irks your sister?” I whispered to Linaniil.\
 \
“Some dumb dream,” she responded callously.\
 \
Neira’s eyes shot up.  “It were not a dream!” she barked.  “An omen it were, I tell ye!”  She turned to me then with pleading eyes.  “Ye must believe me, Aranion.  Something wilst go terribly wrong today.  I saw last night a terrible sight in mine dreams, as if it were a memory of long ago.  There were a burning city, made of glass and silver and marble.  And as it burned I did hear the cries of thousands, tens of thousands, young and old all dying.  And then the city fell, for it had been held in the sky, and it crashed down to the earth with a shattering torment that spilled across the land.  And other cities there were, and pillars of violet light struck up from them, and they did dance around filling the air with the scent of ozone and seared flesh.  Death was everywhere!  Death like none we have ever seen.\
 \
“It were no mere dream I tell ye.  It be a message, a warning - some forgotten tale of the dangers we play with.  We must stop this thing!”\
 \
Linaniil was tapping her foot impatiently as her sister raved, but I could see some of the other leaders looking worried.  I knew I had to quiet Neira down, so I drew myself near and put my hands on her shoulders, looking her calmly in the eyes and bringing my face close.\
 \
“It may well be that this is no dream.  For this is no normal day, and even in all the legends of ages past this will stand out as a day of reckoning.  Our civilisation in under peril, our way of life threatened from the orcish scourge.  We rest upon a knife edge, the world balancing on a pivot, and the wrong sway could tip us into darkness and despair forever.  Our actions today will decide this.  So yes, you have had a warning, you have had a message, and that message is to be strong.  For today we all hold the reins of fate in our palms, and only the steady hand can guide us past the threat of doom that is to come.  Neira, can you be that steady hand?”\
 \
She looked at me with open and hopeful gaze, her fingers clenched around my wrist as if she sought to draw strength from me.  She nodded slowly then.  “I’m sorry Aranion.  I just... I’ll be strong.”\
 \
I turned to the others who all seemed rapt by my words.  It was clear that leaving them to their own thoughts could only bring trouble.  I had to pull them into action straight away.  “It begins now!” I shouted.  “Gather your troops and prepare for the march.  Slow and steady we shall advance, carefully shall we hold the battle, and beyond fire and fury we will emerge free and victorious.  This day shall stand in history forever!  This day shall mark a new era for all the races!  The day of the Spellblaze is here!”\
\
They all cheered and rushed to order their troops, taking courage from the duties of command.  Neira went to her own mages, and I left the pavilion alone.  But outside I was ambushed by Linaniil, who pulled me into an empty tent with a playful laugh.\
 \
“Ye said ye were no leader!” she exclaimed with a grin.  “That were a leader’s speech if ever I heard one.”\
\
I shrugged and smiled modestly.  “I said what I had to.”\
 \
She drew close then, a sudden flush of worry in her face.  “It were just a dream, right?”  I could see then beneath all the bravado and humour she was mortally scared, her fingers trembling as she gazed into my eyes, yearning for reassurance.\
 \
“It was just a dream,” I lied, and it is a lie I have paid for with all my heart and soul.  “Everything will be all right.”  I pulled her close and wrapped my arms around her slender frame, and she held tight to me, still trembling slightly.\
 \
“Thank you, Aranion,” she whispered.  Turning up her face she kissed me, and it was the softest, most delicate kiss she ever gave me.  It was also the last.\
 \
We parted then, and I began the lonely ride back to my own troops.  My heart was now pounding like a deafening war drum, whilst the words of Neira still echoed round my head.  They stirred up a memory in me of a dream I myself had that morning, but that had laid dormant in my mind till then.  I was lying in my bed, and floating above me was a shape of light and air, like the figure of a creature I had never seen before.  It had long tentacles for arms, and billowing robes fluttered about it slowly.  Where it should have a head there was only a small bump, but I could tell it was focused on me.  It stretched out a long tentacle towards me, as if it were warding against a dark and dangerous threat.  A feeling came over me of terrible foreboding, the looming portent of a doom like no other the world had ever seen.  As the tip of the tentacle neared my brow everything went black.\
\
Was it a dream?  Some strange foretelling?  Or could it have been a true apparition, something trying to give me a direct warning?  But I had no time for such thoughts.  The time of the Spellblaze was nearly upon us, and there could be no room for doubt.  I spurred my horse on to my fate.") -- _t

\
I loosened Mooncutter in its sheath as the troops marched forwards.  My grip tightened on the reins, holding my horse in check lest it gallop ahead in the excitement, and I could see my squire to my left doing the same.  The tension in the air was palpable.  Before us, less than a mile away, the vanguard of the orcish armies was now visible.  We had stirred up their nest and they had responded in full force.  They were like a shadowy blight that swallowed up the horizon, a great pestilence that threatened to consume the world.  Before me the armies of the Shaloren seemed small in comparison, but I knew our strength was not told by mere numbers.\
\
Trumpets blared from the bulwarks at the front, as they readied to engage with the first wave when needed.  To the north were archers to crumble the initial resistance, and at their flank a legion of spellriders, their hands glowing with arcane energies as they sat atop their fearsome steeds.  On the south was the regular cavalry, the greatswords, the armoured knights and the main bulk of our mages, readying support spells.  Here and there senior battlemages were dotted about, ready to move swiftly to points of intense activity and blast it away.  There was no need to have more than one of them in any place - alone they could decimate a score of orcs with ease.\
\
Drums beat loudly in the distance, and a clamour arose from the enemy.  They had with them trained beasts and trolls, and were arrayed in swords and maces and crude armours.  One took up a loud howl and others joined in, and the air seemed to reverberate with their ugly voices.\
\
The cacophony was unsettling, but my army responded with a display of power.  Swords and speartips rose into the air, and crackles of lightning shot up to the heavens, the sparks shining off the gleaming blades and armour.  The orcish army gasped in dismay.  The eastern skyline was beginning to glow red, and we knew the dawn would break any moment now, the signal for the start of the Great Spellblaze.\
\
“The day is here!” one of our warriors shouted out, and it was taken up elsewhere by the marching troops.  “The day is here!” they began to chant, anticipating the glory to come.  “The day is here!” my squire sang, his voice full of youthful joy and hope.  “The day is here!” we all shouted in unison, the pride of the Shaloren kingdom in our hearts as we watched the first rays of sunlight shine out from the horizon.  “The day is here!  The day is here!  The day is-”\
\
Silence.  All at once our voices dropped, and a terrible brooding silence swept over the battlefield.  We could feel it, every one of us, so attuned are our race to the flows of magic.  It was like having the breath sucked from one’s lungs, or the earth disappear from beneath one’s feet.  All our mana channels were gone, changed suddenly, arcane energies beyond all reach.  Groans and murmurs began to arise, as mages clutched at their heads in sudden despair.  I saw my squire lurch forwards in his saddle and begin to vomit uncontrollably, my standard slipping from his hand, whilst others fell to the ground in pain.  I struggled to battle an overwhelming migraine, blotches appearing in front of my eyes, and with great effort of will I managed to keep control of myself and began to seek out new paths of mana.\
\
But there was something wrong, terribly wrong.  Like a river run off its course the flow of magic across the whole of Eyal had changed.  What could have caused this?  And now I had to fight years of attunement and training that had taught me to naturally rely on the known flows and courses so that I might find new paths, new sources.  And as I did so I put my powers into divination, and what I discovered shocked me to my core.\
\
The orcs saw us in disarray and began to charge.  But my attention was turned west, not east, towards Elvala and the Crystal Tower where our leaders had been manipulating the Sher’Tul farportal.  But the tower, I felt, was gone - crumpled into the earth, and from there now emanated a wave of white-hot flame.  The orcs tore into our army with little resistance, their weapons tearing through the elven troops, but they were soon met by a wave of destructive energy far greater.\
\
“Shields!” I shouted out as the whole sky turned redder than blood, but above the sudden deafening roar of roasting air I was not heard.  It would have helped little anyway, defenceless as my army was without their usual sources of mana.  Spears of flame streaked down on our heads, shearing through flesh and steel in an instant and sinking into the earth.  The ground shook, and lava blasted up from the deep holes torn into the rock.\
\
I put an arcane shield about myself with a great effort of will.  I saw my squire raise a hand to do the same, but a blaze tore off his arm.  He didn’t even get to scream before another wave burned through the top half of his torso.  Spurting blood evaporated instantly, and the air became full of red mist and fire.  I leapt from my horse as it neighed and stumbled and fell burning into ash.\
\
Another wave came, and I tried to strengthen my shield, but the force of it took me off my feet and sent me flying.  I was thrashed through the air like a swirling leaf, unable to do anything more than struggle to maintain my protection.  All about my army was being utterly decimated, ranks and ranks of soldiers and mages burnt to a crisp or torn apart by the raw energies.  The orcs were the same, and a huge rent in the ground swallowed great numbers of their troops.  Blasts of lava soon thundered upward and rained down for miles around, turning into glowing rivers of death that swept across the consumed landscape.\
\
How I managed to stay alive I am still not sure.  I almost slipped from consciousness at several points, but by a mental tenacity I never knew I had I managed to stay focused and keep my protective shield active.  I became less aware of my surroundings, not knowing if the bubble of my ward was floating through air or fire or blood, or swallowed into the depths of Eyal into some hell never before witnessed.  At last, after what seemed like a tortuous age, the wave of energy passed, and I found myself lying alone on an outcrop of cracked and parched earth, the air a haze of heat about me.\
\
I struggled to my feet and looked around, seeing nothing but desolation in all directions.  Steam and smoke rose from rents in the ground, and blood, limbs and ashes were strewn about all over.  Nothing was alive.  In a daze I despaired that I was alone of the hundreds of thousands who had stood here but a short while before.  Friends and comrades, mentors and students, people I had never known and ones I was dearly close to - all gone.  A sudden pain lanced my heart as I thought of Linaniil.  She could not be dead, surely?\
\
I gritted my teeth and summoned the energy to levitate, and as I rose I began to get my bearings around the changed landscape.  Slowly I pushed north-east, passing over devastation beyond belief.  I struggled to keep a grip on my sanity as the scent of burnt flesh and blood surrounded me, my vision filled with a horrored landscape beyond imagination, the utter silence more deafening than any sound I had ever heard.  Eventually I came near to where the Kar’Krul army had stood, and cast about the ruined land for some sign of life.  Then faintly I detected something, some small sliver of life, and searching it out I found her.\
\
Her clothes had been mostly burned off, her hair half turned to ash, and blood was seeping freely from burns all across her body.  A weak shield still hummed over her, but as I knelt down and laid a hand on her it vanished.  Quietly she gasped a breath before whispering, “Neira”, and sinking into unconsciousness.  She was still alive, but barely.  I looked about and saw no signs of her sister, or of any of the rest of her troops, other than the scorched flesh and blackened bones that marked the scourging path swept by the blaze.\
\
I began to cast what healing spells I could on Linaniil, but I could tell it was not enough, and my weakened powers could not hope to save her.  I began to cry openly, thinking of all I had lost this day, all that had gone so terribly wrong.  Hope had turned to crisis, and the cruelty of fate was far too much for me to bear.  Cradling my dying love’s head in my lap I turned my face to the sky and screamed.  Torment was in my cracked voice, and I raged against all the injustice of life and the futility of war, surrounded on all sides by blood and bones and ashes.  They had once been souls and lives with hopes and dreams, now all cast away like dust in the wind, and I lamented their deaths and my despair.\
\
But mine was just one voice, one torment, a single note in the great cacophony that spread across the continent.  Millions of lives lost and shattered, millions of voices raised in anguish and torture and suffering, as the devastation continued over all Maj’Eyal from the ultimate force of destruction, the Spellblaze.") -- _t

\
Perhaps what happened will never be truly understood.  What Sher’Tul ruins survived the Spellblaze have been little touched since - the burned hand learns its lesson.  But we know that Ephinias and his mages lost control somehow, whatever delicacy and balance they wrought with coming untangled.  At the moment they tried to connect to the other farportals the imbalance was reverberated, resonated, magnified beyond control.  The farportal in the Crystal Tower imploded in a fraction of a second, killing all within and crushing the land about.  The energies in the Sher’Tul relics then erupted in a blaze of white light, turning the air to fire and the ground to ruin.  The blaze swept eastwards, rolling over our battle with an unstoppable destructive force, and then carrying on towards the Thaloren lands.  Most of the ancient forests of Shatur were ripped from their roots, and the lands lain cursed ever since.\
\
Meanwhile the other farportals all over Maj’Eyal erupted, white stone cracking and vast swathes of energy spilling forth.  All of the Cornac lands to the west were turned to desert, the dwarven halls of Korhek crumpled, the midvale plains were risen up as mountains and Lake Nur formed in their wake.  In the south the ancient tower of Darafel was collapsed, and the forests beside it morphed into an ever-broiling scar of lava and blackened earth.  Far in the east the Naloren farportal, the largest of all in Maj’Eyal, disappeared in a vast earthquake that swallowed everything for miles around, and boiling water spewed up to fill its cavernous depths.\
\
And whilst this destruction was wrought the incredible energies disrupted all of the mana flow around Eyal.  Streams of energy that followed set, slowly changing courses, now were flooded and droughted, warped and split.  The threads of the elements were in vast disarray, and any attuned to magic suddenly found themselves far away from their accustomed power sources.\
\
Even the Heavens were changed.  The wandering star of Vor disappeared, the constellations were tilted off their normal course, and the seasons rent harsher since.  Some say the moons dimmed and the sun went whiter after that day.  I do not know.  The whole world has seemed darker to me.\
\
The numbers killed are beyond count.  The initial destruction took at least five million lives, and the terror that followed claimed far more.  For though it had been a day of tragedy and immeasurable woe, it was to be followed by a bloody age of darkness and torment.\
\
But none of this I knew as I lay weeping in the aftermath, cradling in my lap the one life I cared about.  In abject misery I called on all the healing powers I could to bring her back to me for but one moment.  Her heart beat softly, and her eyes opened, but seemed glassy and far away.\
\
“Linaniil,” I whispered, and her dark eyes turned towards my face.  I tried to mumble an apology, to say I was sorry and was unable to help her, but emotions overcame my voice.  Her gaze at me was empty, as if she looked right through me, before she turned her eyes away.  Slowly she raised a hand to an amulet about her neck, and with a light touch it glowed and then cracked.  Her eyes closed again but I could feel the power from the artifact pumping into her, strengthening her heart-beat and mending her flesh.  She was unconscious and still badly wounded, but for now the mortal threat was gone.\
\
My thoughts were mixed - glad she was no longer at death’s door, but worried she might relapse, and at the back of my mind scared of that empty look she had given me.  Could she possibly forgive my part in this?\
\
Carefully I picked up her frail body, and began the journey back to Elvala.  Two days it took on foot, through blasted and ruined ground.  On the passage I came across other survivors, refugees now leaving their destroyed homes, heading to the city to seek shelter.  I tried to nurse Linaniil as best I could, giving her water during brief periods of waking and dressing her wounds, but true healing could not happen till I reached the city.\
\
Elvala was a quiet chaos, oppressed by fear and uncertainty, an air of dread filling all the streets.  The news had broken that our army had been entirely wiped out - there would be no loved ones returning to their families, and the sound of stifled mourning was to be heard in all corners of the city.\
\
I took Linaniil straight to the healing grounds in the palace and gave her to the doctors with the strictest instructions.  They were swamped by casualties, but followed my orders without question, tending immediately to her wounds and applying tinctures and regenerative spells.\
\
It was as I watched over her quietly that a party bustled loudly into the grounds.  I recognised at their head was Perissa, a senior court official.  At her side was an elderly human who immediately went to where Linaniil lay.\
\
“General Aranion!” announced Perissa loudly, “I heard you were here, but I could scarce believe it.  Thank the threads you have returned to us!  This is a grave time; we must talk at once.”\
\
But I ignored her as I saw the human touch Linaniil’s hand, and her eyes gently open.  “Cuilan?” she murmured softly.\
\
“Aye, it is me, my lady,” he said quietly.  “I have been sent here by your father.  He has ordered me to pass you this.”  And with that he brought forth a golden ring set with a fiery ruby.  I recognised it immediately as the Ring of Kar’Krul, worn by the mighty Turthel.  Linaniil sat up quickly, wincing from the pain, but with her eyes locked on the ring as it was placed in her hand.\
\
“But mine father...”\
\
“I’m sorry, my lady.  It brings me great sorrow to bear you this news.  Your father and his court are dead.  His last act was to instruct me to bring this ring to you and your sister.  Neira...” he said glancing about.  “Is she...?”  He saw the look in Linaniil’s eyes and dipped his head despondently.  “I see.  I am terribly sorry.  It becomes my duty then, my lady, to declare you the new leader of the Kar’Krul.”\
\
“General Aranion,” interjected Perissa.  “I really must speak with you now!”\
\
“Wait!” I barked, and turned to the human Cuilan.  “What is happening here?  How could one such as Turthel be killed?”\
\
The man looked at me then with a wan sadness in his eyes, before turning to address Linaniil.  “Yesterday, the day after the terrible Spellblaze, as we began some attempt at reconstruction, still struggling to realign our mana paths, a murmur began amongst the people.  It spoke thus: The Kar’Krul circle of mages had betrayed the ordinary people.  They accused us of siding with the elves to destroy non-mages, of toying with terrible powers beyond our control, of deliberately massacring them out of evil and malice.  We could not logic with them, they would listen to no reason, and they rose up in violent anger.  They attacked many of us, with farming instruments and whatever weapons they could find.  Our defences were weak, and striking back just made the crowd fiercer.  We retreated to your father’s home, begging for help, but he shook his head and said he could not fight back.  They came for us then, storming his palace, and Turthel ordered all to put up no resistance.  He handed me his ring, saying to seek you out in Elvala, and then stepped outside to face the crowds.  He didn’t resist!  The people... they... they...”  He lapsed into sullen silence, shaking his head in sorrow.  He looked like he wanted to cry, but had no tears left to shed.  Linaniil’s face was graven and she stared hard at the ring.\
\
Perissa grabbed me then and turned me to her attention.  “This is what I need to speak with you about, General Aranion.  If this human’s tale is to be believed then we are in very grave danger!  Scout reports suggest there is a body of humans coming here from the north as we speak.  From what this human says they seek retribution - they wish to slaughter us all.  A storm of wrath lies on our borders and we are defenseless!  We need you desperately to organise our defence, to protect our city and our people.”\
\
I felt numb, the events overwhelming me.  “But who leads us?” I said.\
\
“There is no one.  What royals are known to be alive are not suited.  We are entering a time of war, a terrible time like no other we have ever faced.  We need military leadership.  You, General Aranion, you must be our leader.”\
\
I held Perissa’s gaze then and saw the wisdom in her words.  My duty as a Shaloren was clear.  But my heart tremored as I turned to look at Linaniil.\
\
“This be our path then, Aranion,” she said quietly, raising herself from the bed and carefully placing the ring on the middle finger of her right hand.  “I must tend to mine people, and ye to yours.  We will not meet again.”\
\
“But your wounds-” I tried to object.\
\
“Will never heal!” she cried, hate dripping from her voice.  Her eyes were like cold and impenetrable ice, a smouldering anger deep within.  “Come, Cuilan, we must leave this place.”  And with that they departed, Linaniil walking tall and proud in spite of her injuries.\
\
I closed off my heart and my emotions then, lest they overwhelm me.  My duty was before me, and the events of the past had to be locked away from memory.\
\
The ceremony was organised in under an hour, and I was anointed leader of the Grand Council of Elvala, head of the Shaloren people.  On my order rangers began transporting in survivors from outpost settlements, whilst I commanded our remaining mages to begin a new endeavour around our city walls.\
\
The first waves of the storm of hate came the next day.  Human peasants and farmers, ordinary workers armed poorly, their looted swords and spears badly wielded.  I stood alone at our gates as they approached, Mooncutter in my hand.  When the first few charged at me I thrust the blade into the soil and tore a great chasm in the earth, and our mages summoned forth mists and smoke that rose from the ground and began to surround our whole city.  As the peasants stumbled in confusion archers started firing from our walls.  What few made it through the smoke and arrows I took on, tearing Mooncutter through their flesh with little resistance.  Their blood gushed out in the gallons, drenching our ground, staining my skin.  It was like a warm shower over my boiling emotions, a bath of blood to wash over my sins.\
\
The Shroud of Elvala was begun, as our whole city was wreathed in cloud and smoke.  Our shield, our mask, our hiding.  It would last for centuries, the only dealings with the outside world being in furtive secrecy.\

\
We veiled our guilt, cloaked our crimes.  Though we had some communication with the outside through halfling traders and the odd disguised Shaloren adventurer, we remained mute to the world at large, hidden from their accusing gaze.  Outside our quiet walls others had not the luxury of hiding.  The Spellhunt was begun, and it knew no mercy.\
\
Ordinary people rose up against what they perceived as the arrogance of the mages, a revolt against the power of the few that had ruined the lives of so many.  Any suspected of sorcery or ties to the Art were cruelly dealt with.  There was sympathy for none, and many innocents fell victim to the unquenchable thirst for retribution.  The madness swept across the whole of Maj’Eyal.\
\
Law and order had broken down.  Armies, territories and whole cities had been destroyed or ravaged by the Spellblaze, with many areas left completely uninhabitable.  Kingdoms fell and tyrants arose.  Bandits picked at the bones of civilisation like vultures on a rotten corpse.\
\
An organisation called the Ziguranth, thought dead long ago, came into resurgence, gaining popular support from the people in their anti-magic crusade.  We heard of some mages going into hiding, but inevitably being rooted out, or fleeing desperately from place to place.  Dark tales also arose of necromancers and fell wizards creating dungeons and strongholds, fending off or evading attacks, and beginning reigns of terror.\
\
And one tale came to my ears of a group of mages that managed to band together and stay in hiding, though always on the run from the chasing Ziguranth.  The story from outside was that they were led by a demon with fiery hair, fiercely glowing eyes and hands wrapped in flames, that fought with blazing wrath and could be opposed by none.  I knew that description well...\
\
I carried out my reign, my duty, taking care of the Shaloren people.  We were safe from attackers, secure in our supplies through discrete trade, and slowly building back some of what we had lost.  But both fear and shame prevented us from showing our face to the world.\
\
Fifteen long years passed before I awoke one night in my council chambers, the crescent Wintertide moon softly illuminating a shape near the end of my bed.  The figure was tall and slim, wrapped in tight-fitting wools and furs.  Her crimson hair stirred gently as she stood with her back to me.  Memories arose of a night long ago, in a more innocent time, when a younger me and a younger her first became close.\
\
I barely dared to whisper her name, afraid that she might disappear, an apparition or a dream that could be broken by a spoken word.  “Linaniil,” I softly mouthed.  She turned to me, and I saw those same dark eyes I remembered.  But they were surrounded by lines of care, the markings of years of strain and responsibility clear on her face.\
\
Rising from my bed I gathered a robe about me.  I took a few steps towards her but stopped, not able to move myself any further.  I wanted to be near her, to put my arms around her, but it felt as if she were across a wide chasm from me, a gulf of time and pain between us.\
\
“I have come for help, Aranion,” she said in a low voice, not quite meeting my gaze.  “There be something I seek, and ye must aid me in achieving it.”  I did not understand, but I nodded my assent.  “Get ye dressed and ready then.  There be a long journey ahead of us.”\
\
She stepped towards the window, her back towards me again, waiting as I put on a stralite mail and gathered my sword.  When she noticed I was ready she levitated out, and I followed.\
\
We whistled through the air, travelling northwards at great speed.  The lands swept beneath us, and the climate grew colder as we went further and further north.  Hours passed in intrepid silence, till we were flying above snowy tundra.  We soared past plains of white and grey before we reached a low range of hills.  Here Linaniil slowed and descended, and I went down beside her.  We came to rest before a dark opening at the foot of the hills.\
\
Linaniil stood for a while staring at the black cave.  Fear radiated from her face, but her eyes were hard and determined.  “It is here,” she said quietly, her voice steady.  I followed her gaze, trying to guess what secrets this remote place contained, but I could sense nothing special.\
\
She marched forwards and I followed, until we came right up to the shadowed opening.  Linaniil hesitated a moment, staring into the blackness, before finally stepping inside and being swallowed from sight.  I could feel it then, the sensation that something ancient lay in this place.  My skin tingled and my arcane attunement felt on fire.  This dark cave held some mysterious force, secluded from all knowledge since the oldest days of Eyal.  There was something here that could change the destiny of the world.\

\
Light sprung from Linaniil’s staff, and she cast about a luminescence, revealing a narrow icy passageway that led downwards.  It was deathly cold, and our breaths condensed in clouds as we made our way down the wending tunnels.  My skin pricked, and all my senses seemed on edge.\
\
“What is down here?” I asked, my curiosity all-consuming.\
\
“Power,” Linaniil responded, not looking at me as she spake, continuing to follow the path.  “And power be what I seek.  I am afeared for mine people, but have not the strength to protect them as I wouldst like.  With what be here, perhaps, I shall have the power to make a safe haven.  This be a place of legend amongst mine people, and I have scouted it out over many years.  Today I shall finally reach what lies at the centre.”\
\
“And why do you need me?”\
\
She didn’t respond, but carried onwards.  We reached a split in the tunnel, and without hesitation Linaniil took the left path.  It led further and further underground.  We came to blockages, but by arcane force the sorceress easily cleared a way.\
\
As we passed through a large cavern I sensed movement, and drew Mooncutter quickly.  What looked like a disembodied limb, or some great thrashing worm, was writhing towards us pathetically.  Linaniil send a blast of fire towards it - it squealed and went still.\
\
And then more movement, a hundred movements.  From crevasses and holes in the walls and ceiling there burst out dozens upon dozens of the worm-like creatures, their maggoty bodies flapping rigorously, fanged mouths opening up and screaming torturous sounds.  Linaniil growled and began sending torrents of flame towards the approaching horde.  I covered her back, slicing open their pale green flesh and sending strokes of lightning through their ranks.  In under a minute we had dispatched them all.\
\
I prodded a corpse with my foot and it collapsed into sludge.  “What strange creatures,” I commented.  I looked at Linaniil for some explanation but she simply proceeded forward.  I followed after, keeping my sword in hand and watching closely for further attacks.\
\
At the other end of the cavern a wall of ice blocked our way.  Linaniil held up the Ring of Kar’Krul, and the jewel on it began to blaze.  The ice melted away slowly, revealing a passage to another, smaller chamber.\
\
This cold, crypt-like hollow was covered in smooth, glistening ice on all sides.  The walls were square and straight, and ancient pillars of marble were dotted about the room.  On the pillars and walls were weathered runes and symbols.  I came close to study some, but couldn’t recognise them from any of my studies.  “What was this place?” I asked, turning to Linaniil.  “It seems older even than Sher’Tul.”\
\
She ran her hand over one of the walls, tracing the outline of a door.  “It be a temple to Quekorja, god of a race called the Weissi.  The were killed off by the Sher’Tul long before our races were born.  They did build this temple in honour of Quekorja, and the last of them did die here defending her.”\
\
I looked about in awe.  Though I had explored many Sher’Tul ruins I hadn’t seen anything like this.  The architecture was simple but elegant.  There was a crude beauty to it all.  I turned back to the door Linaniil was examining.\
\
She was trying to open it, but was obviously struggling to find a way.  “There be some key, some puzzle to open this,” she muttered.  “But I can nay solve it - the secret be lost to time.”  She growled in anger and stood back.  Holding out her staff she unleashed a blast of arcane force from it, violently splitting the stone door apart and tearing open a passage to a chamber beyond.\
\
Many things suddenly happened at once.  From beyond I felt a pulse of energy, a huge surge of power that I had never felt before.  Linaniil was focussed on it intensely.  But noise came from all around of creatures moving asudden.  From the cave we had entered from there was a shriek of a hundred wailing voices, and the floor beneath our feet trembled.  Rocks fell from the ceiling and out burst horrific creatures with spiked limbs and smooth, triangular faces.  From the trembling ground arose a strange ethereal being of light, with long tentacles for limbs.  And as I turned to face these threats I saw that in the previous cavern the worms had come back to life, and were now coalescing into a huge mass of putrid flesh.\
\
I tried to cut through the being of light, but my sword barely slowed as it passed through it, and the flames I summoned seemed to have little effect.  It raised a tentacle towards me and an intensely bright beam of light shone from it through my torso, filling my flesh with searing pain.  I jumped back and send a wave of ice at it, tearing off a tentacle and pushing it further away.  Meanwhile Linaniil had reduced one of the spiked creatures to a pile of ash, but her arcane shield was collapsing beneath the slashes of the others, and more were spilling from the ceiling.  In the entranceway the mass of worms was pressing through, and from the mouths of the flailing bodies came spits of burning acid.\
\
We were at severe risk of getting surrounded in this confined space, the numbers too many to take on at once.  “Over here!” shouted Linaniil, as she dashed through the door she had split apart.  I followed, slashing my blade through the mass of worms, causing it to lurch back screeching in pain, and spearing a blast of lightning through one of the spiked creatures, splitting open its head.  It continued to attack me, but I parried and cut its arm off, dancing around it and reaching the doorway.  With my back to the opening I brought up a wall of water and sent it flooding into the chamber, pushing the horrors away as I leapt backwards through the door.\
\
As soon as I passed through Linaniil thrust her staff into the ground and a pillar of rock rose upwards, sealing off the opening.  I could hear thrashing and thumping sounds from the other side, but for now we seemed safe.  “What were those things?!” I asked incredulously, as I scanned around the open cavern for signs of any more creatures.  It was a large space, but everything was still, and I could see no other entrances.\
\
“Scions of Amakthel,” she responded calmly.  “The butchered god seeks to break his chains.  But he needs more power...  And here in this dark, forgotten place is part of that power he seeks.”\
\
“And what is here?  What terrible power lies here that would draw both you and those horrors?!”\
\
“Quekorja,” she said.\
\
“Quekorja?  The... the god?”  I couldn’t believe I what I was hearing.  “Was it not slain by the Sher’Tul?”\
\
“Aye, that it were.  But there be power even in a slain god.  Look behind ye, Aranion.”\
\
I turned then, wondering what she wanted me to behold.  It took me a moment to see it, but when I did I gasped in shock.  The far wall of this great cavern was not merely a wall.  It was covered in a thick layer of ice, but beneath at its centre I could make out a huge yellow eye.  And around that eye I could trace out a giant form.  Dark grey skin covered a bulging head, topped with three great curved horns, which sat atop a long, thick body with six limbs.  It was deathly still and chillingly ancient, seeming more like part of the rock than anything that had once been alive.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, but I could feel it.  In that corpse was still power, immense power, like nothing I had ever felt before.\
\
“This be it,” said Linaniil.  “One of the few corpses of the gods left to find in Maj’Eyal.  And I shall take its power as mine own.”\
\
“This is insane!” I shouted.  “You have no idea if that is safe or not.  You don’t know what it will do to you!”\
\
She chuckled darkly.  “Aye, that be true.  But that is why I have brought ye here.”  I looked at her in confusion and she chuckled again.  “Ye still know not your purpose here.  Did ye think I took ye here for protection?  That I couldst not handle those horrors on mine own?  No, there be a different reason I have brought ye.  When I absorb this corpse, when I take its power for mine own, I do not know what wilst become of me.  It may kill me.  Or it may drive me mad, it may turn me into something terrible.  Should that happen, Aranion, you art the only one I know with the strength to kill me.”\
\
The words hit me like a blow to the chest.  “Kill you?  But I couldn’t...”\
\
“But ye must!” she said firmly.  “After all ye have done... all the torture ye have brought my life... ye owe me this.”  I looked deep into her eyes and saw the turmoil of emotions within, the pain and agony of all that had befallen her, the hatred and blame of those who had wronged her, the guilt and shame for not being able to do more herself.  And deep inside still some touch of love for me and what we had shared.  I reached out my hand and stroked her soft hair, my fingers touching lightly against the side of her face.  I leaned in close and she closed her eyes, turning her face up to me as I moved my lips towards hers.\
\
“No!” she suddenly cried, pushing me back.  “It cannot be!”  She swiftly turned from me, and I saw a tear drip down one cheek.  “The world has changed, Aranion.  I have a duty before me, and none can walk that path beside me.”  And with that she began to run, staff in hand, towards the great eye whose dead gaze was locked behind the wall of ice.  I sprinted after her, but she was faster, and with running leap she thrust the base of her staff through the ice and into the center of the god’s eye.\
\
The ice cracked with a deafening thunder, and the giant yellow eye pulsed before exploding in a ball of light.  I stopped and covered my eyes as white light flooded the room and shards of ice flew through the air.  I could barely make out Linaniil, bathed in light, hanging with one hand from her staff, her hair and robes blown backwards as she reached forwards with her other arm.  Slowly, intrepidly, she placed her hand into the centre of the ball of light where the eye had been, and shadows danced about the cavern as she wrapped her fingers round that luminous sphere, before squeezing tight.\
\
The cavern shook, her staff shattered, the wall creaked and split before wholly blasting apart.  The corpse of the dead god collapsed into a stream of silver and in a roaring cacophony rushed towards Linaniil, tearing apart her robes and sinking into her skin.  She floated in the air, limbs outstretched as the vast energy poured into her flesh.  She opened her mouth as if to scream and light burst out, and light spilled from her eyes and ears.  The cavern quaked dangerously and rocks fell from the walls and ceiling.  But in seconds it was over, the corpse of the god fully absorbed, the light in Linaniil’s eyes went out, and she dropped to the ground like a stone.\
\
Then the horrors broke through, the collapsing cavern having made an opening for them, and immediately they sped hungrily to where Linaniil lay.  “No!” I cried, rushing to intercept them.  “You cannot have her!”\
\
I sliced off the head of a spiked creature and put up a wall of fire ahead of the rest of them as I backed towards Linaniil’s body.  She looked dead, with no sign of movement or breathing, but I had no time to check.  The being of light and tentacles passed through my flames without resistance, and I ran sparks along my sword as I tore it up the centre of the monster.  It shot light through my torso and I coughed up blood, but I forced my sword in deeper and ran a flood of arcane energy through it, blowing the thing apart.  More spiked creatures came, and I took care of my footing whilst parrying and chopping on my left and sending waves of flame to my right.\
\
The mass of worms broke through the wall, and with it two more luminous horrors, and some fiend of darkness and nightmares, and I could see behind others were spilling through.  I put up a shield as rays of light shot towards me, and sent balls of frost back at them.  One of the light beings fell, whilst the other was slowed.  The dark thing came quickly, and the mass of worms not far behind, so I sliced my sword across the ground, sending heat through it, and turned the stone into a mass of lava.  The dark thing came around it, and I felt an aura of deathly cold from it as it approached.  I hacked at it desperately, and it shot back speared limbs towards my chest that seemed to suck all strength from me.  With a roar I shot a pulse of flames down my blade and it burst apart.  The worms charged directly over the lava, squealing in pain as a bulk of them were burned, but coming at me with speed.  I adjusted my grip, getting ready to make deft strokes to stay out of its range, but a lance of light then shot through my leg, dropping me to one knee with a scream.  The mass of worms rushed at me then, and I dug my sword deep into their midst, but the worms crawled over my arms, digging their acidic teeth into my flesh and reaching for my neck.  With my left arm I cast a blanket of flames over them, burning my arm along with the screeching worms.  They pulled away slightly, but the being of light was approaching from the side, a tentacle flaring up in luminescent energy, and three spiked horrors were behind it.  My right arm was burnt, my left leg injured, my mail pocked with holes, and my mana reserves were running low.  But I gritted my teeth in determination - I could not back from this fight.  I rushed at the mass of worms with my sword held firm.\
\
It exploded in a fiery mess, and an intense wave of force and fire blasted across the cavern, turning the other horrors to ash, and even burning through the luminous being - a low scream arising from it as the flames tore it apart.  I gasped, not knowing whence this blaze had come, until I turned around and saw Linaniil.  She was standing tall, her robes burnt off, flames dancing up and down her skin, bright light shining from her eyes.  Heat seemed to radiate from her.  I kept my grip on my sword, not sure if this was the Linaniil I knew, or some other force born of her union with the dead god.\
\
She laughed suddenly, and it was a harsh laugh that I had not heard her make before.  “What a fool I have been,” she said, almost to herself.  “I brought ye here in case ye had to stop me.  But now...  Now mine power exceeds ye by a long distance.  Ye would have no hope of opposing me!”  She made a low sound somewhere between a laugh and a sigh.  “Ah, but ye have no cause to worry.  I am still me.  Mostly.  And through pain and sacrifice I have achieved the power I desired.  The power I need.”\
\
I let my sword dip and breathed heavily, relief mingled with trepidation sweeping through me, whilst the withdrawing adrenalin of battle left me feeling exhausted.  I looked Linaniil over, her pale skin now glowing, her eyes brimming with energy and vitality.  I saw the power she had was not in mere force, but that she had taken on the ageless nature of the gods.  A power forbidden to all creatures was now hers and hers alone.\
\
“What now?” I said quietly.\
\
“Now, ye go home, and I go to make mine home, a sanctuary for me and mine people.”\
\
“Will we meet again?”\
\
She smiled sadly.  “Mayhaps.  Mayhaps not.  The world changes quicker than predictions can tell.  But if we do meet again it shall be in a place that does not yet exist - the city of Angolwen.”  She raised an arm then and from it shot a tremendous pulse of arcane energy, the violet light shooting to the roof of the cavern and spearing through, deep through, till it split the rock apart right through to the open sky a mile above.  Sunlight spilled down, splashing over Linaniil’s lithe form.  It had been many hours since this long long night had begun.\
\
“But for now, farewell Aranion,” she said as she began to float from the ground.  And then she sped up and soared out of sight.\
\
I lay down on the cold stone, resting for a while, slowly healing my wounds and recovering my strength.  I reflected on the events since the evening before, thinking back on the trials of all the races of Maj’Eyal.  War, disease and death threatened all equally.  Was Linaniil beyond that now?  How would a taste of immortality affect her?\
\
It was then that thought for our race came to me.  In ages past we had searched for immortality.  Our ancestral leaders had obsessed over it, but out of vanity, pride and a fear of death.  What would the real effects be if all our society were to be gifted with it?  With immortal life we might separate ourselves from the strifes and wars of the world.  It would give us a perspective beyond the petty squabbles and prideful competition of the other races.\
\
I dug through the ice and rocks and found still some trace of the dead god Quekorja, faint though it were.  I gathered all that was left and made the long journey back to Elvala.  There I retreated to my labs, studying the remains for years before finally unlocking its secrets.  It was thus that immortality for our race was born, and it has changed our outlook on the world ever since.\
\
We stood apart from the others then, not engaging in war, finding a new respect for life.  It was not till Garkul the Devourer assaulted our gates in the Age of Pyre that we ever had cause for large scale war again, and I rode out to face him in combat.\

Be aware, necromancy isn't all weaving mighty spells of undeath, wearing flowing black robes and crushing entire nations beneath the feet of your mighty undead horde; you'll have to put in some elbow grease as well. Your first few bodies will have to be stolen away personally as few people will aid a necromancer willingly, and those that do are rarely competent. The cemeteries of small towns and villages are good sites for your first acquisitions, but if time demands it don't be afraid to \"make\" some specimens of your own with the aid of a sharp knife or heavy bludgeon. Once you have your first minions out performing your bidding you needn't worry about resources any longer; opportunities to practice your art will, quite literally, pile up.\
\
Also important is the upkeep of the bodies themselves. True, this is not strictly necessary as sufficient enchantment can bestow mobility upon even the most ruined and incomplete remains, but making sure that the joints and cruses of your prospective minions move freely and with ease much reduces the will required to grant them reanimation. It also makes for a sturdy and reliable base in case you desire to undertake larger, more audacious projects (see 46. Bone Giants & You).\

tDef(110, "#{italic}#2. Domination Of The Deceased#{normal}#\
\
A contentious issue arises when it comes time to breathe life into your gathered specimens - do you raise them as lifeless drones, or do you bind the souls of the deceased within their vessels once more? There is much disagreement on this between the various movements of necromancers. The Beinagrind method of necromancy extols the torturous imprisonment of the soul as fundamental; the anguish generated by the captive spirit makes for a much more effective undead thrall, they claim. The recently founded Tren? method however disagrees, claiming that allowing souls freedom not only results in more obedient slaves less prone to rising up and slaughtering their masters, but also causes your work to become marginally more acceptable to the unwashed masses. Sure, they'll still thrash you, drag you through town and burn you at the stake if they get the chance, but they'll feel ambivalent about it, by thunder!\
\
Remember, when utilising a runic circle to bend your new minions to your will, make sure beforehand that every rune in the circle is enchanted properly and in no danger of fizzling out. If the unthinkable happens and one of your thralls is freed from your control, offer them goods or equipment in exchange for your life. Few undead will kill their creators after receiving such an act of generosity.") -- _t

tDef(121, "#{italic}#3. Unwanted Attention#{normal}#\
\
Sadly, it is not only the peasantry and our \"virtuous\" archmage cousins that disapprove of our work. Though not entirely understood, necromancy is known to create \"ripples\" of a sort across the many dimensions, ripples that attract extra-planar attention. As a necromancer's power grows, so do said ripples, until eventually said necromancer finds all manner of demonic force and entity beating down their door, both mentally and physically.\
\
Once again, opinions differ on this demonic interference. Necromancy is such a beautiful, divergent art, is it not? The Tren? method sees the necromancer's corruption by outside forces as a negative thing, and practitioners of said method often take measures to divert supernatural attention from themselves, creating talismans to act as spiritual \"conductors\" or living close to the communities that despise them, the life essences of the masses masking the necromancer's dark emanations. On the other hand, the Beinagrind method welcomes the cursed whisperings that come from the demonic realms, believing it to be the completion of their psyches. Only once their spirits have been \"corrupted\" (a term Beinagrind practitioners scoff at) do people realize their true ambitions, they claim. Why these \"true ambitions\" always seem to be the utter and complete destruction of all life in this world and the summoning of unthinkable atrocities from the outer dimensions is unexplored.\

You may have noticed that no instruction has been given on how to deal with the attention of common folk. That is because a true necromancer requires none. They are vermin, fit only to be crushed.") -- _t

The greatest enemy of the necromancer is other necromancers. Well, apart from the Ziguranth, the Allied Kingdoms, the Shaloren, the Thaloren, the Iron Throne, common townsfolk, undead hunters, adventurers, rogue undead and Linaniil. But apart from them, the greatest enemy of the necromancer is other necromancers.

\
So, apparently I'm a legend now. Hah, knock a vampire's head off with a greatmaul and suddenly you're up there with Toknor and Mirvenia apparently. More and more often these days I get novice adventurers coming up to me, asking me for advice when it comes to battling the undead. My first instinct was to tell them to get back home and become bakers or gardeners or something. If they need crib notes for combat they obviously aren't cut out for it.\
\
But then I was thinking, these are good kids. Heck, I'd buy every man and woman in the world who's bumped off a ghoul a free drink if I could. If they want help when it comes to putting down necromancer slime and their chilling creations, I would be more than happy to oblige. Not much of a writer, but let's see. First...\
\
#{bold}#1. Ghouls#{normal}#\
\
Every once in a while, people come to me and say \"Are all necromancers truly evil?\" \"Surely necromancy could be used for good!\" \"Isn't it wrong to discriminate against others simply because of the magicks they practice?\" To these people, the first thing I usually say - shortly after giving them a black eye - is to take a look at a ghoul. Take a good, long look. Take in the diseased, putrescent flesh. Take in the oozing, exposed organs. Take in its features, slowly rotting to mulch. It used to be a person. It used to have a family, people who loved it. Now it's a walking corpse, its only desire being death and the mad, all-encompassing consumption of living flesh. Are all necromancers truly evil? A thousand times, yes.\
\
Even this most basic of undead minions can strike terror into the unprepared. The multitude of diseases that a normal ghoul carries are contagious in a manner many adventurers do not truly appreciate until they see the sores and necrosis visibly spreading up their arm from where a ghoul bit them. Such maladies must be dealt with promptly: if bitten by a ghoul, immediately plunge the afflicted area in scalding hot water, then wrap it quickly in clean cloth lined with mugwort and quartz powder. The wound must remain dressed for three weeks, with new dressings applied every four days, and make sure to burn the old ones! Failing the above, a wild infusion also works splendidly.\
\
    * * *\
\
\
#{bold}#2. Skeletons#{normal}#\
\
What guide to the undead would be complete without mentioning the humble skeleton? Despite these clattering and chittering bones of the deceased often looking so fragile that a stiff breeze could break them apart, in many ways they are more dangerous than their ghoul cousins.\
\
With no masses of rotted and ruined flesh to reanimate, necromancers can commit themselves fully to bestowing some level of fighting skill on a reanimated skeleton, and since a fighter's weapons will often last as long as his bones will, skeletons are usually armed and sometimes even armoured. The potential skill of a skeleton doesn't stop at melee weapons either - fallen archers take up their bows once again, and although difficult by comparison, some necromancers can even grant dead mages their magic powers once again.\
\
Some adventurers find themselves baffled when it comes to fighting skeletons. How do you destroy a foe who, by all rights, should be destroyed already? To these adventurers, I say take heart. The more broken and incomplete a body is, the more effort it takes to keep it reanimated. As most necromancers see skeletons as the lowest of low peons, you can expect a few good blows to easily dissipate the minimal effort their masters put into creating them.\
\
    * * *\
\
\
#{bold}#3. Wights#{normal}#\
\
Wights are an odd duck amongst the undead, often not created by necromancers specifically, but instead rising of their own volition when the conditions are right. Wights are by no means individual souls, but often part of a gestalt; when a particular land has seen enough bloodshed - battlefields, forest, crypts and graveyards - wights can be seen to rise en masse, a near-physical representation of the battles and turmoil the land has faced. Sadly, it is for this reason that necromancers often facilitate the creation of wights regardless, for no other study or profession causes so much blood or death.\
\
Those who have had encounters with wights often describe them as indistinct skeletal figures, wrapped in flowing cloaks that become faded and incorporeal at their edges, while strange lights dance where their eyes should remain. Survivors tell of a peculiar sense of exhaustion when in close proximity to them, as though merely being close to these figments of death causes one's life force to sputter and fade. Regardless of this and their ghostly appearance however, it has been recorded that steel and strength of arms is yet enough to destroy them, or at least to erase them for the time being. It's just a shame that such battles are likely to simply create more of them in the long run...\
\
    * * *\
\
\
#{bold}#4. Vampires#{normal}#\
\
Vampires are so far removed from other varieties of undead it seems almost unreal. What grants them their longevity? How do they retain such great intelligence? Beyond their sallow complexion and drawn features, why do they not decay and decompose as their ghoulish siblings do? The study of vampiric nature is one long list of unanswered questions, each new study adding yet more to the ever-growing pile.\
\
As said before, a vampire's greatest strength is its resemblance to a living man, both in mind and body. Thanks to this, vampires are known for residing comparatively close to normal towns and villages far more than other undead. Some have even been known to keep their lairs within these communities themselves! Despite their resemblance however, there are many telltale signs of vampirism: Unnaturally pale skin, long and distinctive fangs, an aversion to sunlight, and much more besides. In an effort to avoid close inspection, some vampires are known to masquerade as men of wealth, often cloistering themselves in remote locations to discourage prying eyes.\
\
But perhaps the most astonishing thing regarding vampires is their propensity for alliance and familial relationships. No other undead being even approaches matching the incomprehensible tangle of clans, broods, families and bloodkin that vampires create for themselves. It is for this reason that vampires often end up becoming rulers of lesser undead themselves, commanding them as a normal necromancer would. So, in turn, treat them as you would a necromancer - with cold steel.\
\
    * * *\
\
\
#{bold}#5. Spirits#{normal}#\
\
During my travels, I have noticed that some communities in the wild no longer bury their deceased as is the norm in larger settlements. Some folk burn the corpses of their fallen, committing their ashes to the earth instead. When asked why they perform this peculiar practice, I always receive the same answer: Necromancers. Fearful of their dead rising up to slay them at the whims of delusional, murderous filth, they believe that with the burning of the dead, their spirits are forever beyond the reach of a necromancer's bony fingers.\
\
Alas, this is not true. While fire may burn away a man's physical being, no flame can touch his spirit. Unfortunately, necromancers can. Bereft of both body and freedom, many souls are driven mad in the employ of necromancers, ceaselessly drifting through windswept crypts, harrying any unfortunate wanderers they encounter with a multitude of curses and hexes. Worst of all are those spirits who embrace their newfound purpose, causing them to grow in power at a frightening rate. No other being in Maj'Eyal is so obviously abhorrent to existence itself as these \"dreads\"; it is almost as though creation itself wants these beings gone from her world. It is my hope that you, and many others, oblige her wish.\
\
    * * *\
\
\
#{bold}#6. Bone Giants#{normal}#\
\
One of the most horrific, vomit-inducing expressions of the necromancer's so-called \"art\" is the bone giant. Not content with merely profaning the bodies of singular souls, some ambitious necromancers work to bind the bodies of countless skeletons together, creating hideous engines of destruction that can stand many times higher than the height of a normal man.\
\
It is a deadly mistake to liken these abominations to the golems alchemists and archmages employ. Wilful and fey as they are, normal mages often only craft golems for utility and their own protection, while necromancers create bone giants for the sole purpose of dealing death, and the only limit to their destructive capability is the necromancer's twisted imagination. Ever fought a snow giant? Imagine one with six arms and fingers like blades, wrought of sharpened ribs. Imagine one with countless skulls lining every inch of its wretched body, all screaming for your blood to be spilt as it thrashes spinal columns like whips from its disfigured hands! After facing one of these grotesque amalgamations, you'll be begging to go back to the Daikara to pick on simple, frost-rimed sub-men.\
\
    * * *\
\
\
#{bold}#7. Liches#{normal}#\
\
Hate made flesh. Evil made pure. Death incarnate. The culmination of a necromancer's work. Whatever you know liches as, I can tell you that they do not match the countless myths and legends that surround their terrible figures. They surpass them.\
\
Once a powerful necromancer finally crosses the border between life and death, the abyssal power that they could only initially grasp in dribs and drabs becomes theirs to control totally. It is often said that unexpected quakes, crops failing, and the leaves simultaneously falling from the trees heralds the birth of a lich. Lords of the undead, liches can annihilate ghouls and skeletons, banish dreads with a glance, and reduce bone giants to powder within moments.\
\
As to how to actually destroy one? Well, tell you what. If you manage to defeat one of these abominations, be a dear and write a guide for me, for I have absolutely, positively, no idea.\

But Caldizar convinced him that this life of peace was not possible whilst the schemes and machinations of the gods continued. And so reluctantly Branzir accepted, and took in his hands the great sword Madrath, and upon his shoulders was laid the title \"Godslayer\".\
\
In the great Godhunt that followed Branzir became the most fervent of the Godslayers, and would not sleep nor rest whilst a hunt was on. He it was that chased the troll-spawner Ugg'matho through the snow-capped mountains of Pertolias and broke his body on the highest peak.

But Ralkur seeing the wrath of the hunter and the terrible sword became frightful, and he took on the form of an antelope and fled across the Harloe Plains. But Branzir ran after and ran swifter and nigh caught him before they reached the Woods of Darmin. There Ralkur assumed the form of a monkey and took to the trees. But Branzir tracked him and followed close, overcoming the traps his foe left behind. Then the forest fell away and they came to the Azure Sea, and Ralkur took the form of a gull and flew over the waters cawing with prideful glee. But Branzir was unfazed and leapt into the water, swimming after the cowardly god with all his strength. Twenty days and nights he followed through the ocean, feeding off fish he could catch near the surface, whilst Ralkur beat his wings on the winds above. Not once did Branzir lose sight of his target, and with each passing day Ralkur became more and more filled with fright.\
\
Finally they came to the far shore of Tar'Eyal, and Ralkur fell onto the sandy beach bereft of strength. Depleted of all energy he reverted to his natural form, short and squat, and stumbled across the sand before falling down exhausted. Branzir arose from the water behind, and in spite of his trials he stood tall and fierce, and marched with purpose towards the cowering god. He drew out the fell blade Madrath from its sheath and held it to the throat of his prey.\
\
But Ralkur, in a last desperate effort, took on a pathetic and piteous form, and wailing and crying he begged Branzir for mercy, promising to leave all Eyal and never return. And Branzir, looking on the divine form sunk to such depths, was moved in his heart, and agreed. But he said in a solemn tone, \"Get thee then from this world, which we mortals now claim for our own. Remove thyself from all influence in Eyal, and never dare thee to return. But if thou doest break my trust, let thee be afeared. For then not a breath shalt thou take that it will not be a gasp, and not a step shalt thou take that it will not be in flight, and each beat of thy traitorous heart shalt be a pounding of terror. For I shalt come for thee and I shalt find thee and even to the depths of Infinity I shalt hunt thee without rest till my hands are on thy throat and thy life is crushed to dust.\" And when he spake the wind fell silent and the sky turned black, for when a Sher'Tul speaks so his words become Words of Power, and they can change the world forever. And Ralkur hearing those words was filled with a dread beyond conception, and forgetting all exhaustion he immediately took the form of a swallow and flew high into the sky beyond all sight.") -- _t

tDef(117, "Branzir returned to his people, and continued the hunt for the other gods, till but one god remained: Amakthel. Then the last great Godhunt began, as the Sher'Tul fought to overcome their maker and master. And this was no easy feat, for Amakthel was by far the strongest of all the gods, and many Sher'Tul were still loyal to their creator. Much blood was spilled before ever the assault on his throne could begin, and much blood would spill still after.\
\
Now Ralkur had fled into the heavens with the full intent of passing beyond all reach of mortals forever more, such was the fear laid on him by the solemn words of Branzir. But as he soared higher and the fear faded, he came to change his mind, for he was a prideful god and moreso a vengeful one. Thoughts and schemes began to build in his mind for how he could gain retribution on the Sher'Tul that had brought him to shame. So he took on the form of an eagle and flew above the highest volcano in Eyal, and there he stretched his wings and glided high on the rising heat, watching all that happened in the lands below and biding his time for vengeance.\
\
He watched with joy as he saw the Sher'Tul armies fall before the forces of Amakthel's fortress. He watched with anxiety as he saw the Sher'Tul finally break through the defences and come upon the great god himself. He watched with awe as he saw the nine Godslayers do battle with their creator, and several broken before his almighty wrath. And then he watched with utter terror as he saw the mightiest of all gods felled, and maimed and mutilated and bound, and cast into the darkest depths of the world.\

He flew down screeching, and spreading his wings he let loose spikes of steel that rained down on the keep, cutting through wood and stone and flesh. All who were in the keep were killed, and the air was filled with Ralkur's cackling laughter as he flew away.\
\
But the vengeful god had been hasty at the last, for Branzir was out hunting at the time. Coming back the next day he saw his home in ruins, and all his family and servants butchered, and sorrow and torment filled every corner of his being. On hearing reports of what happened he knew well the perpetrator and his fury was incandescent. He sought the aid of the other Godhunters in scouring out the stray god, but they were all divided, and each engaged in the politics that would lay the seeds for war. Perhaps if they had aided him then the popular Branzir could have helped unify the people and stop the madness that was to come. But Caldizar was gone, reportedly aggrieved and repentant at their acts, and the remaining Godslayers thought only of their own powers and making gods of themselves.") -- _t

He came upon the god in a settlement of lesser creatures who worshipped him, and he ruthlessly cut down the pathetic wretches that tried to protect their new deity. Ralkur fled at the sight of Branzir and his dark blade, filled with all-encompassing fright. But Branzir was not to be lost, and chased him into some nearby ruins. There Ralkur laid traps and summoned enemies and fled deeper into the darkness. But Branzir overcame them all and came on faster, till they reached the depths of the dungeons. And being out of space the god created new space and fled further, and kept on fleeing. And Branzir carried on chasing, not letting up for a second as the pursued god continued to delve deeper into the ground.\

And so the chase continues. Over centuries beyond count Branzir has never stopped to rest or sleep as he pursues his prey through the ravages of infinity. And though death would be a welcome reprieve he thinks only of the hunt and of vanquishing the cowardly god.

How there could be such a decisive and total failure on our part to stop this threat remains a mystery - the source of the orcish invasion remains unknown. A battalion of soldiers will form a defensive perimeter around Reknor until a force to retake the mine and exterminate the orcs can be mustered.

This is a grave and unprecedented issue, so I decree an oath of silence to be laid upon all citizens of the Iron Throne, regardless of class and station: NO NEWS OF THIS INVASION MUST REACH FOREIGN EARS. We must maintain an image of stability and strength with the Allied Kingdom, as any signs of weakness or internal strife would be catastrophic to our alliance and future trade agreements. Any citizen found divulging this information to any outside party will be punished with exile. Rest assured, I will personally send messages to those outside the Throne who can be trusted with this information, and I trust this orcish intrusion shall be dealt with swiftly and decisively.

Alas, food may well be the least of our worries, for the orcs have begun to attack our strongholds. Thankfully we have had time to reinforce the existing structures. Indeed, little work was needed, for the foundations of this place are strong. My loremaster tells me it was abandoned following the Crimson Pox, but was once the capital of Mardrop.

Last night as dusk approached, the orcish armies began to prepare a major attack. My men were ready, for I was determined that if they were to have our lives they would pay for them thrice over. But as the sun waned in the western sky I saw what looked like a rain of gold falling amongst the orcish troops and suddenly they were in disarray. Another flurry came and I saw that it were not gold, but bolts of steel reflected in the setting sun. \"The halflings!\" my scout shouted, and lo I saw then it was indeed a large army of halflings come upon the orcs' flank.\
\
The orcish army suddenly forgot about us, turning upon their new enemy. But foolish is any who ignores the wrath of a caged lion which sees its chance for vengeance! I led my men immediately into battle, taking the enemy swiftly from the rear, and throwing their organisation into madness. When the halfling army came upon their flank it was a massacre, and we drove them mercilessly towards the southern lake. There upon the shores we beat them to the last number, and their blood stained the water a horrific black.\
\
Our victory sealed, I immediately met with the halfling leader, and found it to be no less than the princess Mirvenia! Truly words cannot express my joy when I saw her face flushed red in the last embers of the setting sun. I almost felt... no, I should not think such things.") -- _t

Mirvenia has been key to the discussions and the plans. She is a tactical genius, and I am constantly amazed by her wealth of knowledge and skills. There is an odd woman that accompanies her though, with long fiery hair and a silken robe - Linaniil is her name. One of my men swears he saw her riding into battle in a blaze of flames, burning all the orcs before her. The idea of a spellweaver in our midst is unsettling, but Mirvenia says I should trust her.

tDef(136, "#{italic}#A study into Southspar's most unusual ruler.#{normal}#\
\
Chances are you haven't heard of Southspar.\
\
And why would you have? It was naught but a tiny, provincial island kingdom off the coast of Tar'Eyal that existed within the Ages of Allure and Dusk. By all accounts, Southspar was a pleasant place to live; temperate climate, healthy trade relations with mainland human kingdoms, and by great luck, the island upon which the kingdom sat held great deposits of the much-valued metal stralite.\
\
Despite this good fortune though, Southspar was doomed to mediocrity. Why? The actions of its ruler. By all accounts a bumbling, octogenarian dotard, his name lost to the mists of time, this mouldy monarch mismanaged Southspar almost to its demise. The Dwarves of the Iron Throne, having heard of the stralite beneath the island, manipulated the king into mining it and selling it to them for a fraction of its true worth. Also, despite Southspar's decidedly puny military power, the king saw fit to send whatever troops he could muster to aid mainland human kingdoms in their great and many wars against the halflings, who up to this point had barely registered Southspar's existence. Not only were the undertrained, ill-equipped troops crushed like vermin before the superior halfling forces, but also these foolhardy attacks succeeded in attracting the halflings' attention to their secluded island. Almost immediately, the raids began.\
\
From what records remain, the king was mystified by the decline of his nation, believing to the end that every action he took had been the right one. He passed away soon after the halfling raids began. Whether it was suicide, assassination, or simple old age is unknown. The king never married and had no children, the only remaining member of his family being a distant cousin, a young man named Drake.\
\
And so it was that Drake ascended to the throne, and Southspar entered a golden age.\
\
#{bold}#1. Drake and the Halfling Horde.#{normal}#\
\
To the newly crowned Drake, the most obvious and immediate threat to Southspar was the growing raids and sorties being held by the halflings. To this end, he ordered a complete and total reconstruction of Southspar's military, turning them from a ragtag bunch of militia into a small yet devastatingly efficient engine of war. Drake knew that the only advantage his forces held over the halflings was their knowledge of the island, and so bade them to travel stealthily, carry small, armour-defeating stralite knives rather than spears and swords, and only engage with the halflings strictly on their own terms. Southspar's newly assembled \"Army of Rogues\" was a success. Although the halflings were great in number, strike after surgical strike from Drake's army weighed heavily on their morale, and finally, grumpily declaring Southspar \"not worth the bother\", the halfling forces withdrew.\
\
Southspar celebrated its peace and its newly found military might, but for Drake, the celebration was short-lived. The stralite he had used to craft his Army of Rogues' knives and armour was stralite that wasn't going into the Dwarves' pockets, and they were far from happy. Drake formulated a plan - by the time he was through, the Dwarves would be even further from happy.\
\
#{bold}#2. Drake and the Stralite Stratagem.#{normal}#\
\
The Dwarves have always been a secretive race. Even now only a select few know the location of their \"Iron Council\", and in the days of Southspar there were still those who considered Dwarves nothing but myth. Being a monarch in possession of large amounts of stralite can open even the most concealed of doors, however... Drake had requested an audience with the Iron Council, and the Dwarves, expecting said audience to be a humble apology and promises of further stralite for the gold they were paying, readily accepted.\
\
What they got, in reality, was quite different. Gone was the ineffectual king of Southspar's past, and now the Dwarves found themselves facing a young, hard-eyed human who was demanding that the amount of gold that the Dwarves were paying for Southspar's stralite be increased twenty-fold.\
\
To say the Dwarves scoffed at this would be an understatement; open, derisive laughter hits nearer the mark. Despite Southspar's recent repulsion of the halflings, the Dwarves of the Iron Throne saw no problem in taking Southspar's stralite by force. In his heart, Drake knew they could accomplish this, and it was to this end that he had brought the small pouch around his neck to the Council.\
\
Drake held the small, drakeskin pouch high, opened it and emptied its contents onto the floor: Stralite, ground to dust, muddied with dirt and base metals, made unusable and worthless. The Dwarves of the Council gasped in horror at this waste, one (if rumours are to be believed) even fainting on the spot. Drake went on to say that, if his demands were not met, the entirety of the stralite beneath his island would meet the same fate as the stralite cast upon the chamber's floor.\
\
By the time Drake left the Iron Council, the Dwarves had agreed to pay thirty times the previous amount.\

tDef(172, "#{bold}#3. Drake and the Conclave Mages.#{normal}#\
\
With its borders unassailed, ands its coffers rapidly filling with Dwarven gold, many believed that the fortune of Southspar could not increase any further. Drake, however, had one last task to accomplish, and it regarded the Conclave.\
\
For a long time, a small number of Conclave mages had made their home in Southspar. The remote location and the doddering nature of its old king meant that they could perform experiments and practice magic that would have been disallowed on the mainland. Being reclusive by nature, only a few of their group had heard of the rise of the new king, and none of them had cared much. Drake's royal guards breaking down the door of their study, followed by the king himself, gave them cause to care. Drake had for them an ultimatum:\
\
\"This is the kingdom of Southspar, my kingdom, and so everything within her borders must be within my control. This applies to her people, her land, her resources, and now her magic. I shall allow you to remain here in Southspar on one condition: You become members of my royal court, obey my commands, and use your magic for the betterment of the kingdom. When un-needed you may tend to your Conclave matters as you will, but your greatest loyalty will be to me. Do you accept?\"\
\
The Conclave mages' response? Laughter. But this laughter was not the mocking laughter of the Dwarves, but laughter of disbelief. As recorded, the mages' response went as:\
\
\"King Drake! You needn't have bothered us with such a stern ultimatum! A simple request would have sufficed. True, in the past we may have chosen to reside here for simple seclusion, but it is hard to ignore Southspar's rising star. This kingdom's glory shall continue to grow, and we want to be a part of it. We accept.\"\
\
Freedom from halfling attacks, Dwarven fortunes, and now the magic of the Conclave blessed Southspar. What, the common people thought, could possibly happen next?\
\
Mere weeks after the Conclave joined the royal court, Drake fell ill and died.\
\
#{bold}#4. Drake and the Empty Throne.#{normal}#\
\
Drake was dead, and Southspar's people were struck with depression and outright horror. Their king, who was fast on his way to making their kingdom one of the greatest in Maj'Eyal, was no more. The throne lay empty; not a single soul vied for the now vacant position of king. As far as Southspar's citizens were concerned, it was Drake's throne, nobody else's.\
\
The norm in tales like this would be that the kingdom slowly managed to get back on its feet, recover from the loss of their king, and finally return to a state resembling normalcy. Not so for Southspar. Drake's demise had left a wound that was not healing, and it was clear that something had to be done. One of the men closest to Drake in his life, his chancellor, left abruptly on a mysterious \"errand\", hoping that the kingdom would not crumble before his return. After a period of some months he did return, and his first port of call? The study of the Conclave mages. He held in his hand a tome, bound in skin and marked with blood-red runes. Its subject matter was obvious: Necromancy. The chancellor had but one command for the mages:\
\
\"Bring him back.\"\
\
#{bold}#5. Drake and the Pale Kingdom.#{normal}#\
\
Here, sadly, definitive facts on Southspar and Drake's fate vanish. Some say that Drake's rebirth was a resounding success, and Southspar's star continued to rise as the now skeletal Drake retook the throne, the gaze from his exposed skull unchanged from his mortal visage. Others believe that the madness that grasps those returned from the grave took him, and with the new powers that the Conclave had blessed him with began a reign of terror that drowned Southspar in blood. The only fact that can be known for certain was the new name his subjects gave to him in his death: Pale King Drake, the Pale King, or simply Pale Drake.\
\
I leave you with a copy of one of the last pieces of Southspar's history, a partially destroyed scrap of parchment, supposedly written moments before the Cataclysm and Southspar's destruction, falling beneath the waves along with the rest of Tar'Eyal.\

tDef(227, "The Oceans of Eyal represent a frontier which we have been powerless to break. In spite of advanced craft and skill, and even the more forbidden areas of magic, there are natural barriers that we simply cannot overcome. Long range seafaring has become seen as unprofitable and a fruitless endeavour. The last great ship to be built was the Vanguard, over a thousand years ago, which disappeared over the eastern horizon and was never seen again.\
\
Yet we know that the Sher’Tul once travelled the whole globe, that records exist from our younger days of other continents, of sailing routes that go right round the whole of Eyal. How it stirs my heart to think of the unexplored lands that lie beyond our stormy coasts!\
\
Alas, records from the time of the Spellblaze and the Cataclysm show that those old routes can no longer be traversed. A reshaping of currents, an increase in storms and a greater abundance of dangerous sea creatures have all locked us onto the continent of Maj’Eyal.\
\
Yet my desire for knowledge is not sated. I spoke some time ago with an old fisherman - a halfling sea dog with a crusty beard, hideous scars, and the foul stench of stale ale all about him. Inbetween the wretched smelling breaths from his toothless mouth he told me some valuable information. I transcribe it as best I can here:\
\
“Nay, ya’ll not get long out b’ond coast thar. In th’orth ya’ll run inta ice floes, miles wide stretches at’ll close in on ya and crush yar hull fro’neath. Out west be a field o’ storms, cyclones and hur’canes tha’ll swaller up any ‘at go near. And out east... ack, out east be th’orst. Nagas and sea dragons, switchin’ currents and ocean rifts, storms of hate like y’never seen in yar worst nightmares. As fer south, well tha’s best spot fer fishin’ and the like, we gots some good patches thar. But venture too far and ya meet a... I ‘unno, some magicy barrier or whatnot. Ships hit ‘gainst it like a wall o’ air. Go too fast and ya smash yar prow apart! And out b’ond it... some cloud of darkness lies on t’rizon. We stays clear o’ that, I tells ya.”\
\
It’s a remarkable report, and one I’m minded to believe, in spite of the notorious unreliability of seafarer tales. South was once the continent of Tar’Eyal, said to be a desert-smothered land full of wild energies. What fate has swallowed it from our access now is hard to say. But my curiosity is sorely piqued, and I shall endeavour to charter a ship to investigate this strange barrier to the south. Likely the lesser races that crew these vessels would balk at such an enterprise, but I’m sure that with the leadership and influence of a Higher like myself I can persuade them to have a little more backbone.\

Lessons are off this week as my tutor has fallen ill, so I've decided to sneak out and have a wander round the old mazed ruins nearby. I know I'll get in trouble if I'm caught, but as long as I'm back in a couple of days no one will notice... Besides, I get so bored cooped up in those mountains! I want some fun!\

This is rather a dirty place though. I've come across a few bandits and snakes in here, but nothing to threaten a grade 3 mage like me.\

I remember hearing that this labyrinth used to be a prison used by the halfling king Roupar during the Age of Dusk, and that with the lawlessness of the time captives were simply sent here to rot.

Though armies would fall before the Spellblaze's might, though forests were razed and the skies bled red with fire, they always felt that the earth would endure. It seemed eternal, unmoving. Not even the fury of the Spellblaze could hope to destroy it.\
\
How wrong they were. The Nalorën people, long secluded, were prepared to fend off any attacks on their land, but how could they hope to stop the land itself crumbling? Seeing their home literally tearing itself apart, plains and forests tumbling into the seas... For one brief, terrible moment, they beheld the true extent of the Spellblaze's power.

Nalorë civilisation was reduced to a few isolated and feeble settlements, scratching out meagre existences as land, mind and body was warped in both shape and spirit.\
\
Faced with the idea of their great race failing – another victim of the Spellblaze, a footnote in the annals of history – impassioned pleas were sent to their elven brothers: The Shalorën, the Thalorën.

It was during this period of grim introspection that salvation was suddenly and unexpectedly granted. The ancient Sher'Tul magicks, long pondered over by the land's mystics, would bear fruit at last.\
\
The same force that destroyed the Nalorën would save them. Through the Sher'Tul's magic, the Nalorën became able to breathe water as if it was air. Their bodies became adapted for existence under the waves, their legs becoming long, snake-like tails. Such drastic metamorphosis would naturally cause horror, you may expect. However, the Nalorën saw the possibilities their new forms provided: Their sunken lands were their own once again. Their homes would be rebuilt, their civilisation reborn.

You too may have some small experience with these \"wargs\" as the locals are wont to call them. Now... imagine one the size of a bear. Truly, as I travelled the lands surrounding Derth did I come across such a monstrous, awe-inspiring, lupine adversary. With fangs of a length to match my own blade, I entered combat against this lupine lord and its skulking brood. To my regret I failed in slaying the beast, but I assure you - simply surviving against such feral rage is an honour worthy of recognition and renown.\

And indeed, would there have been much glory in killing such a creature? True, I would have had enough to fur to line each and every boot and hat in Derth, but legends must live on. They are what give this world its very spirit!\

Your petty escapades are made ever more insignificant by the trials I myself have recently overcome. Mere days ago I was trekking through the Old Forest (that's outside Derth, Weisman! Terror must already grip you!) when, by unfortunate happenstance, I came across a most hideous, bloated, oozing and chittering horror! No less than the giant ants' repulsive progenitor!

Such a magnificent sight! With wings of fire, leaving the air itself hissing and smouldering in its wake, I could only watch with rapt amazement as it alighted on a rocky outcrop mere yards away from me, the stone beneath its talons warping from its tremendous heat.

I remember when I first woke, and I drew my first breath, and the fresh young air of the world filled me with vitality. I opened my eyes, and above me stood a figure of outstanding radiance. She was tall and slim, crowned in silver hair that fell to the ground in silken tresses. Her skin was pale to the point of luminance, and her eyes were brighter than the stars.\
\
I watched her for what felt like a century, and she watched me, and I saw tears form in her eyes. I did not have a voice yet, but I thought, \"Why does she look so sad?\" And I felt then her reply in my thoughts, \"For you are beautiful, and far more beautiful than all else in the world. But this is a world of pain and sorrow, and I cannot bear to think of my creation come to harm. I will give you strength to endure many years, and a voice to express all desires, but the burden of sadness will follow you forever. At that thought I weep...\"\
\
I felt then strength come into my limbs, and a voice rise in my throat. I rose to the ground and I looked around, and in awe of the world around me and the stars above me I sang loudly for joy. And the woman smiled as she heard my voice, and her tears stopped, so I continued to sing for a while to entertain her. But then I said, \"Am I alone?\" She nodded, and said, \"There are no others like you.\" At this I felt sad, and she could see the loneliness in my heart. She seemed to hesitate a moment, and said, \"Though it pains me, I cannot deny your desires. You will sleep now, and when you awaken you will be among people like yourself, and you will walk out into this broken world and try to mend it.\"\
\
As she finished speaking I instantly fell into a trance, and when I awoke I saw the world had changed, and there was now a blazing light in the sky - it was the new-born Sun. And I saw all around dozens more people like me, and others similar in appearance but varying in traits and abilities. I woke them up, and gathered them together, and we all expressed delight in each other's being, and named ourselves Alor?. But the woman was gone, and no others knew anything about her, and my searches for any trace of her were in vain.\
\
Times passed and changed, and other creatures were found, and oft they were fell and vile and we did war with them. Then we found the Sher'Tul, and they delighted in our beauty, and taught us the ways of the Arts. And then the War came, and some of us helped them in their battles, but soon we saw we had no place beside such masters, and we retreated to the woods as the War raged to its catastrophic conclusion.\
\
In all those centuries I still searched for the woman and found no trace. I know that the gods were all hunted down, and I remember the thorough searches of the Sher'Tul in their holy war. I grow old now, and some of those who first woke with me have passed away, and each passing night seem ever colder and lonelier.

tDef(217, "Many are the tales of how our world was made, from the absurd to the romantic to the horrific. But they are all mere myths, with no more than seeds of truth to even the most reliable. The history of our race goes back far, but it is tantalisingly scant in details from before we met the other races. Indeed, it is only through our battles with the others that we halflings have any ancient records at all.\
\
The elves one would suspect of having the greatest knowledge of elder times, but they are aloof and silent. One must judge from this that either they do not know, or that the truth ashames them. The latter would certainly not surprise me.\
\
The humans have more myths than they have brain cells. It seems that each village has several versions of their own local tales, usually passed down orally over the ages. It is clear that not a single element of any of their myths can be construed to contain any essence of the truth.\
\
The dwarves are reticent about the subject of how they were made. They say that such talk is \"not profitable\". However upon further pressing (and bribing) they will open up a little further. They as a race are of the most fervent belief that they were the last people to be made in Maj'Eyal. They say they are the \"final product\". Their word for all other races in fact translates directly to \"prototype\". This mostly singular outlook does of course seem absurd, but one need only look at the rest of dwarven society to see that they are an absurd race with ridiculous ideals. If they are what they consider perfection then I thank whatever god made me that I am flawed!\
\
The subject of gods is of course a difficult one. Clearly there are no divine forces at work in the world today. But the world as we know it did not come from nothing, and even the great Sher'Tul clearly did naught more than manipulate the world - they did not make it.\
\
By logical conjecture one can only presume that some great being made the world. This must have been a benevolent being, for it is clear that \"He\" created creatures separate from himself to walk the earth. Clearly this is we halflings. We are the only race that truly appreciates the world. We do not warp it with magic experiments like the Shaloren, nor hide from it like the Thaloren. We do not bring destruction like the orcs, or petty greed like the dwarves. And our understanding and knowledge is so far advanced than the humans that it is hard to understand why we share the same world with them at all. We were quite clearly the first of the current races to be created, and our natural feelings of entitlement to all there is in Maj'Eyal must stem from this.\
\
Now that this has been clearly analysed in logical terms, one must consider the source of the other races. It is impossible that they were made by the same god - truly impossible. What strange being could create our race, so gifted and rounded, and yet make such warped and twisted creatures as the dwarves and humans? No, clearly other gods were responsible, lesser gods than our own which copied his grand design. But with fudging fingers and inelegant touches the works of their design were clearly far inferior to the subtleties and perfection which crafted us.\
\
However there remains the matter of the Sher'Tul. Clearly these were of greater power than us, and yet they disappeared. One must presume that our god made this race before us, but was somehow unhappy with them, and so removed them and made us instead. We are not as powerful as the Sher'Tul - not yet at least - but we have our own gifts that evidently give us a greater place in our creator's heart. This would explain why we were the first race to unlock the powers of the Sher'Tul farportals. We had a natural affinity to the works of our elder brethren.\
\
So what happened to these gods after they had made the races which we see today? One must presume strife between them, and that they killed themselves, or took their battle away from the world. Our creator, seeing the other gods killed or left, must have then entrusted the world to us halflings, knowing that we would rule over it in his stead. This is why at every point in history we have played a pivotal role in the shaping of our world. It is our rightful inheritance, and it is our duty to rule it well.") -- _t

And so Gerlyk made him two younger sisters who danced around Eyal\

But the moonsisters became jealous of their brother's affection,\

Thus Gerlyk separated them so that Eyal would only ever dance with one at a time.\

tDef(371, "I begin my writings with a study of the humans, currently the most populous of the races in Maj'Eyal. The greatest kingdom in number are by far the Cornacs, but mention should also be made of the Sholtar and Mardrop kingdoms, and the Higher bloodline. The biggest human population centre is around the citadel of Last Hope, though many other settlements exist across all corners of Maj'Eyal.\
\
Cornacs are normally around 5'9\", with generally dark hair, brown eyes and ruddy features. Most Cornacs take up roles as tradesmen, farmers, or other manual labour jobs. It is a sad fact that the majority of bandit groups tend to be dominated by Cornacs. Cornac families tend to be large, and since the Age of Dusk their population has expanded rapidly, especially in the farming lands in the west and around Last Hope in the south.\
\
Sholtar are generally 5'11\", with dark skin, hair and eyes. They originate from the south-east of Maj'Eyal, and are few in number since the Cataclysm tore much of their land into the sea. Their affinity with nature is renowned, and they are often found employed as healers, infusion crafters or wyrmic huntsmen.\
\
Mardrop humans are all but extinct, after the Spellhunt and the plagues during the Age of Dusk. They were known to be powerful spellcasters, and as such were prime targets by the spellhunters. However some trace of them can still be found, as their fiery hair and freckled skin oft can appear in those of distant descent. A few are rumoured to still possess citadels and towers in remote locations.\
\
Highers are on average 6'0\", with fair hair and skin and blue or grey eyes. The majority of scholarly roles are taken up by Highers, and they tend to fill most of the noble classes. Some say this is due to discrimination and elitism, though these may simply be jealous sentiments. There are also rumours that the superior intellects of Highers are due to arcane experiments instigated by the ancient Conclave during the Age of Allure, but I have found no records to support this idea and must consider it to be baseless. The Higher bloodline is renowned as a mark of excellence, and mixing with lower bloods is strongly frowned upon.\
\
All human kingdoms were united by King Toknor the Brave in the Age of Pyre, and remain under the rule of his son King Tolak the Fair. A full discussion of the long human history would require a far more detailed document.") -- _t
tDef(386, "Loremaster Greynot's Analysis of the Races - Chapter 2 - Halflings") -- _t
tDef(387, "There are two main kingdoms of halflings, the Eldoral and the Nargol, though both mix often. All halflings are just under 4' tall, and are generally noted for their large feet and curly hair. Eldoral are usually fair-haired and blue-eyed. Nargol tend to be darker in hair and complexion, with hazel eyes, and oft slightly shorter than their cousins. Halflings are known for their intelligence and quick wit, but also their arrogance in dealing with other races - something they do not deny, for they say it is well-deserved.\
\
Halflings used to be the most dominant race in Maj'Eyal, with control of many strategic Sher'Tul ruins and rule over great swathes of land. The recorded wars between humans and halflings are numerous, and the halflings were the most often victors. However the Age of Pyre brought them great ruin, for the orcs seemed to target them more fiercely than any other race, and many of their communities were wiped out. This has forced them to rely more on trade with other races in modern times, especially with the humans.\
\
The Eldorals used to have a kingdom in the north of the continent, but most of it was destroyed during the wars with the orcs, and not much has been rebuilt. However they do still have many agricultural settlements such as Derth, albeit shared with other races. The Eldoral are known for their great healers and farmers, and their slingers are considered the best in all the lands.\
\
The Nargols once had many strong fortifications in the south of Maj'Eyal, but though they suffered less than the Eldoral in the Age of Pyre they still lost great numbers, and much of their centres of population dwindled. The rise of Last Hope has accelerated this process, as many communities are subsumed into the city's suburbs. Nargols are known as great jewellers, alchemists and rune-crafters, and possess some of the best tactical minds of all the races. Many generals and military advisers are employed from their kingdom.\
\
The most famous of all halflings is Queen Mirvenia, most famed for her saving of King Toknor in Last Hope from a siege of orcs. Mystery still surrounds how she managed to bypass the winter's icy floes with her army to reach the citadel in time to rescue Toknor. Some have hypothesised that she enlisted the aid of sorcerers, but none of her troops would talk about the journey afterwards. She wed King Toknor in the second year of the Age of Ascendancy, and gave birth to the first known mixed race child - Tolak the Fair.\

tDef(402, "The dwarves are an exceptionally secretive and quiet race, reluctant to talk about themselves to outsiders unless hefty bribes are paid. Many times in their history they have cut off all contact with the other races for no known reason, shutting tight the great iron doors that cover the trade passages to their mines and their cavernous cities. However of late they have become more open with the outside world, and I have even had the pleasure of receiving the unique distinction of being allowed to enter their main city, the Iron Throne, and speaking with several of their guild leaders.\
\
Dwarves are around 5' tall, with generally brown or grey hair. They are usually stocky and muscular, and known to be very resistant to any physical suffering. Their females can be hard to distinguish from their males, but can usually be identified by the beads braided into their beards. All dwarves are highly proud of their beards, and take immaculate care of them. The greatest insult to a dwarf is to belittle his beard, and the greatest sign of suffering in a dwarf is for him to tear at his beard.\
\
Dwarves are known especially for their smithwork and artificing, which is unrivalled amongst all the other races. They also make cunning merchants, known to drive a hard bargain. Their society consists of a fairly strict caste system, with families belonging to guilds of miners, smelters, craftsmen, and so on, and deviance into work outside of one's guild of birth is almost unheard of. However there is no perceived inequality between guilds, with each having equal representation on their ruling Committee of Guilds. Who actually acts as figurehead is unknown to outsiders though, and no amount of bribing will encourage any dwarf to speak on the subject. When it is mentioned in passing their allusions to a leader are normally marked by an almost religious reverence.\
\
Their skill with metal is renowned above all else. Dwarven steel is considered the most durable material for use in construction, and dwarves are the finest workers with stralite and voratun, precious metals of immense value. They trade heavily in their crafts from their capital the Iron Throne, but allow no outsiders in - instead they send innumerable merchant caravans out to all the cities to ply their wares.\
\
As well as the many merchant dwarves one may meet there are also a great deal of young dwarves who venture beyond their halls of stone. These are generally of adventuring fare, and it is encouraged in dwarven society to experience something of the wider world in one's younger years. This is known to them as being \"smithed upon the anvil of the world\". In private though some senior dwarves admit that this activity is promoted to help with their \"market research strategy\".") -- _t

tDef(416, "Though the elven races look very similar in appearance, they are extremely distinct in history, culture, mindset and many subtle physical traits, so I shall write of each of them separately. All elves are marked by their long, pointed ears and high cheek-bones, but other features can vary greatly. It should be noted that they call themselves as a whole \"Elore\", which means \"siblings\", yet the interactions between these brothers and sisters are oft strained.\
\
Shaloren (or Shalore - lit \"siblings of grace\") are on average 6'2\", with bright hair and blue or purple eyes. They are usually slim and lightly built, more marked for their mental prowess than their physical strengths. They are however known to be extremely swift of movement and light of foot. But of particular note is their magical affinity, which is far stronger than any other race, and their intense powers of will.\
\
The Shaloren have a long history of magic-use which continues to this day. Though other races shun the dangers of magic to a large degree, the Shaloren embrace it, and it is still widely used throughout their society. However they are careful to hide this in their dealings with other races. The Shaloren were the ones that began the Spellblaze, though they would soon have it forgotten, and the memories of blame run deep amongst many. During the Spellhunt in the Age of Dusk they locked their city doors and shrouded the whole region in mist, only coming out in secrecy. It took many centuries before they were accepted again in wider society, and still they are treated with intense distrust.\
\
Their capital city is Elvala, in the south-west peninsula, and they have very few settlements outside of this. They have naturally long lives, and their mastery of the arcane arts has allowed them to extend their lives indefinitely. The eldest immortals make up their Council of Elders, which is headed by their King Aranion Gayaeil. Death is a particular fascination amongst the Shaloren, and early kings of their race were said to build great tombs for themselves whilst experimenting in flesh preservation and necromancy. The Shaloren of course deny this.\
\
They deal with other races seldom, preferring to keep a low profile, and most of their trade is done through halfling intermediaries. A few rune-crafters and enchanters sometimes travel to other major cities to do business, and some brash youths are known to explore further afield.") -- _t

tDef(430, "The Thaloren (or Thalore - lit \"siblings of wrath\") are on average 6'4\", with dark brown hair and hazel or green eyes. They are generally of muscular build, and known for their physical prowess. They are renowned to be of a fey mindset - as quick to furious violence as they are to joyous song. Their relations with the Shaloren are particularly strained, as they strongly oppose their brethren's use of magic.\
\
Their capital city is Shatur, hidden deep within the northern woods, and they are loathe to let any outsiders even approach the surrounding forest. Archers and fighters carefully patrol their borders, ready to rain down death from the trees on any who encroach. Their leader is Queen Nessilla Tantaelen, and they are said to live in extensive dwellings carved into giant trees, but little else is known about their society.\
\
Those who choose to leave the fastness of the forest tend to be of unique disposition with unusual attitudes and traits. Oft they are musicians, bowmasters or skilled warriors. However they are sometimes mistrusted heavily, as rumour has it that many of those who leave Shatur are actually criminals expelled for the very worst crimes. In any case they tend to be natural loners who wander the world on their own personal quests.\
\
The Thaloren do business very rarely with the outside world, but when they do it is normally for metals and certain foodstuffs that they cannot get themselves. Usually in trade they sell woodcraft and fine silks. This is the only legal source of elven-wood, a rare commodity that is often sought after for fletchwork. Black market sources rely on poachers to cut trees from the Shatur forest - an immensely risky business, but also very profitable for the high prices paid by Shaloren mages for an elven-wood staff.") -- _t
tDef(441, "Loremaster Greynot's Analysis of the Races - Chapter 6 - Naloren (extinct)") -- _t
tDef(442, "The Naloren (or Nalore - lit \"siblings of spirit\") are now an extinct race, as their homeland was swept into the sea by the Cataclysm. However as a separate elf race they are worth studying, scant though the records be. Much of what is now said about the Naloren is traced with myth, but one can deduce certain facts.\
\
Naloren elves were around 5'10\", with blonde hair and green eyes. They were incredibly thin, but known for their swift and dextrous capabilities. Their kingdom was located on the eastern side of Maj'Eyal, and all of their towns were on the sea or straddling major rivers. They employed themselves as fishermen, sponge-divers, sailors and musicians. They were renowned for being able to stay underwater for hours at a time, and those with arcane abilities were said to be able to stay submerged indefinitely.\
\
They traded little with the other races, and were very protective of their coastal lands. They most especially guarded jealously an ancient Sher'Tul ruin that lay in the centre of their territories. The Shaloren were in particular keen to study this relic, but the Naloren always refused them access, though they were too afraid to touch it themselves. The orcs were said to encroach on their lands often, but were always fought back by their mail-clad warriors wielding vicious tridents.\
\
Alas their love of the sea was to be their undoing. When the Cataclysm came the whole of the coastal kingdom was shorn away and fell into the sea, annihilating almost the entire race. What small numbers survived committed suicide soon after by leaping from the eastern cliffs into the ocean, following their fallen brothers and sisters. Almost no evidence of their civilisation remains.") -- _t
tDef(453, "Loremaster Greynot's Analysis of the Races - Chapter 7 - Ogres") -- _t
tDef(454, "Ogres have never been a thriving race, starting from their abrupt appearance as soldiers and laborers for the Conclave during the Allure Wars (unexplained aside from a highly implausible story from the Conclave's Overseers about a lost mountain tribe).  Left without homes or proper runic training after the war's end, they were forced to found their own tribes and rediscover the fields of rune and infusion creation for themselves, and though their numbers dropped rapidly, they enjoyed a brief period of relative success as nomadic rune-traders, virtually unaffected by the Spellblaze.  The Spellhunt nearly proved to be their undoing, as their monstrous size and rune-covered skin made them popular targets; they were thought to be extinct, and only in recent years has the city of Elvala revealed that some Ogres took refuge there during this time.  Their descendants still live today, fearful of persecution but gradually beginning to explore outside Elvala for the first time in ages.\
\
Ogres' most striking feature is their size, by far the largest of any intelligent race; they average at roughly 8'4\" tall, and most are nearly half as wide with muscle.  They have a similar range of skin tones to humans, although slightly grayer on the whole; their hair tends to be dark brown or black, and their eyes run the gamut from black to bright blue to purple, presumably a side-effect of runic mis-transcription.  Their angular facial features invite some impolite comparisons to Orcs, with strong jawlines, disproportionately large mouths and teeth, and squarish heads, but otherwise resemble those of humans.  It would be remiss of me to describe Ogres' appearance without mentioning the intricate, glowing pattern of runes covering their skin from head to toe, although the exact patterns and colors vary.  \
\
Although they excel at physical tasks for obvious reasons, and the necessity of careful inscription has made their finger dexterity (and penmanship) rather impressive, their limb movements tend to be slow and clumsy due to their size, and they tire quickly if they over-exert themselves during strenuous labor.  Their slow speech, incredible appetites, and lack of interest in arts or most scholarly concerns has led to a misconception that they are dim-witted; however, Ogres forced into studious tasks have performed admirably, and one needs only look at their runic patterns to know the patient study and artistic vision they are capable of, if properly motivated.  This may tie into the humble, duty-bound mindset that seems to be an inherent property of the species - most Ogres show absolutely no interest in leadership or impressing others, only completing tasks in the most reliable manner possible, and such strategies tend to be rather simple.\
\
While Shalore use of magic is (arguably) a choice, Ogres have no such luxury.  Their inscriptions are as crucial to their well-being and structural integrity as any internal organ, and attempts by Ziguranth to \"cleanse\" captured Ogres of their runes invariably lead to them first collapsing under their own weight, then their organs shutting down one by one; one can assume that their natural infusions are just as vital.  As such, Ogre reproduction is a careful task; a newborn can live for a few months unaltered, but after this the parents must give their child a thorough regimen of runic inscription and herbal infusions.  The parents typically perform this task together, using each others' runes as a reference, and any mistakes made in the transcription will affect the child's health and development (usually adversely, though it is believed that transcription errors are responsible for mitigating Ogres' once-uncontrollable tempers).  As such, the inscribed patterns are as much of an influence on the child's development as the physical and mental traits of his or her parents.	\
\
Due to the safety and comfort of Elvala, and their mistrust of much of the outside world, most Ogres who leave their home do so for trade purposes; no longer using Shaloren as couriers, some have begun to enter the growing market of runes and infusions, and have proven very successful thanks to their natural talent in this area.  Those few who could be considered \"adventurers\" tend to pack up their things and leave abruptly, not for glory or riches, but because they see a recurring source of misery in the world and wish to dispose of it themselves as a public service.  It is not uncommon for an Ogre to sigh in frustration after hearing about a hijacked shipment of grain, head out, return a few days later with the blood of a once-persistent bandit clan stuck to his club, and go right back to tending his crops.") -- _t

tDef(468, "The orcs are, joyfully, extinct from Maj'Eyal, following the purge instigated by King Toknor the Brave at the start of the Age of Ascendancy. But an academic study of their previous culture and civilisation is still of interest, primitive though it may have been.\
\
Orcs were generally around 6'1\", with green or black skin. They varied greatly in physical appearance and build, most likely due to their exceptionally fast breeding rates. The majority of orcs were thick-built and heavily muscled, well remembered as the stock grunts of their terrible armies. However in the Age of Pyre a greater number of thinner, stringier orcs appeared, oft versed in destructive magics.\
\
The orcs were first encountered by the Eldoral halflings, who tried to use the simple creatures as servants, but gave up after finding them to be too violent. In the many centuries since wars and battles have been almost continuously fought with the brutes. Their oft superior numbers have at times threatened to overwhelm all of civilisation, even leading to such drastic defensive measures as the Spellblaze. The most terrifying time though was during the Age of Pyre, when the orcs developed arcane abilities, and under the leadership of Garkul the Devourer they swept through the continent, mercilessly slaying all before them. In the end 10,000 halflings gave up their lives in the Battle of Nargol to defeat their demonic leader and stem their army's advance. Gradually the civilised races began to recover, and finally King Toknor and Queen Mirvenia succeeded in uniting the human and halfling kingdoms, putting together a force to push back the orcs and ultimately extinguishing them entirely.\
\
Recent investigations of orcish ruins have revealed a surprising amount of cultural material, and even crude artworks based around fertility and battle. Some evidence has also been found of strong community elements to their culture, with much focus on sporting activities and racial pride events. However these are still clearly lacking in the subtleties and aesthetics of our more advanced cultures, and any attempt to compare them with us must be overshadowed by their brutality, territorial violence, and obsession with war.\
\
There have been no substantiated reports of orcs for over 100 years. What reported sightings there are tend to be from such unreliable sources as adventurers and hermits, and have never been verified. We should be thankful that these horrible creatures have been banished to the annals of history, surviving only as stories to be told to misbehaving children.") -- _t

tDef(482, "Ah, the legendary Sher'Tul! How any scholar does love to write about them. Indeed, the texts are many, but the facts are few, as so little is known about this crucible race. The most learned and factual academic on the subject is the renowned explorer and archaeologist Darwood Oakton, but he has alas been missing for several months at the time of writing. I will attempt to summarise here some of his key discoveries.\
\
The Sher'Tul lived over ten thousand years ago, during what is referred to as the Age of Haze. The name of the race we know from the elves, who speak of the ancient beings with awe and reverence, yet know little else about them. Ruins of fantastical Sher'Tul structures have been found all across Maj'Eyal, and some have been observed in sunken lands off the coasts, implying that in their time the Sher'Tul must have ruled unopposed all across the world.\
\
The farportals were first discovered by the halflings during the Age of Allure, and after much experimentation they were found to be able to transport items and creatures over vast distances. The arcane powers behind these incredible artifacts are still far beyond the understanding of the greatest minds of our time. The one attempt to truly tap into these powers ended in disaster - the Shaloren moved all known farportals to a remote spot near their capital, and their most powerful mages were overwhelmed as they unleashed the Spellblaze, killing them instantly and tearing apart the continent. What remains of farportals are left in the world have since been left untouched.\
\
Of their physical appearance we know almost nothing, as there is no surviving artwork or records which depict themselves. However they must have been of similar form to other common races, as their ruins contain stairs, doorways and rooms not unfit for humans. Oakton estimates from his studies of their tools and artifacts that they would have stood around 5'4\" tall, with uncommonly long limbs and fingers.\
\
What caused them to become extinct is unknown, though many theories abound. The most popular in academic circles at the moment is that their mighty magics were their undoing, turned upon their own people during some great civil strife. Other theories hold weight though - Archiman Garybald, Professor of Demonic Studies, believes that the extensive uses of arcane energies by the Sher'Tul may have attracted twisted forces from other worlds which wiped out the ancient race. Some even believe that they are not truly extinct, but are in hiding, or have left this world for elsewhere. I fear the truth may never be fully known, but the ongoing study and examination of the relics they have left behind continues to provide immense value and inspiration.") -- _t

tDef(496, "No text would be complete without at least a brief note of some of the more brutish races which infest our world. These do not hold any civilised society of note, nor in general do they seem capable of any form of higher thought or culture, but they are still of interest to study for any who take delight in analysing beings of more primitive intellect.\
\
Trolls come in two main types - Kezrak and Moltep, or stone and forest trolls as they are colloquially known. Stone trolls infest many mountain chains to the north-east, and some have been known to wander further afield in search of food or to spread violence. They are generally over 8' high, with extremely pronounced muscular strength and a thick, solid hide which bears the appearance of coal or granite. Forest trolls are generally found in dense woods or swamps, with the Trollmire east of Derth being especially infamous. They have a more advanced form of speech than their mountain-dwelling cousins, and are known to move faster and wield more elaborate weapons, though their greenish hide is not as thick and their musculature less developed. All trolls have intensely fast metabolisms, capable of healing from grievous wounds within a matter of hours. At birth they measure just eight inches long, but within two years grow to full maturity, and rarely live beyond ten years old. They used to be considered little more than beasts, but towards the end of the Age of Pyre many were trained as fighters by the orcs, and were even taught the basics of language and certain battle tactics, making them much more dangerous. Though the orcs are gone their servants remain, and their remote breeding areas and intense birth rates have so far scampered attempts to eradicate them completely.\
\
Giants live mostly around the mountainous peaks surrounding the Daikara Pass. They vary greatly in size, but are normally at least 10' tall. They look somewhat like large, deformed humans, with swollen or distended facial features and much longer, swinging limbs. They live in nomadic tribes, moving from peak to peak with the seasons, feeding on wild deer and goats. They are usually peaceful creatures, only turning violent when their territory is encroached or their young are threatened. There are sometimes reports of giants coming to lowlands and stealing farm animals or attacking communities, but these are rare and normally isolated to particularly harsh winters. Giants seem to have no developed culture or language worth mentioning, but have been noted to show interactions of limited intelligence and to commune well in groups.\
\
Nagas were once believed to be mere myth, but reliable reports and even the capturing of dead physical samples has shown them to be real creatures. The upper half of their body is humanoid in form, with blonde hair and an extremely thin build, but the lower half is like that of a giant snake's tail. They stand around 6' tall on land, though their tails extend several feet further. They have been encountered off the eastern and south-eastern coasts of Maj'Eyal, which seems to indicate some exotic civilisation beneath the waves. Records of them exist only from the last few hundred years, and only more recently have they been interpreted as more than just the wild fantasies of inebriated sailors. They can breathe in air and underwater, possessing both lungs and gills, and have been reported to move with surprising speed on the ground. One might think them simply odd monsters, but they decorate themselves in jewellry and craft weapons and armour from materials found on the sea-bed, such as supple mail formed from layers of thick shark-hide. This would suggest an advanced culture, but communication with them so far has proved impossible. It is not known if they are capable of complex speech, but to date their only response to those who encounter them has been extreme violence, and fishermen in the east are always wary of coming across these vicious creatures.\

The origin of Demons is not wholly known, but it is clear that they are capable of intelligence and so I feel the need to describe them somewhat here. It is known that they can be summoned by certain magical rites, and minor demons were oft in the employ of evil sorcerers during the Age of Dusk. The main theory, which is supported by certain studies by Shaloren archmages, seems to indicate that they come from another world than our own, with connections formed through intense arcane energies. It must be a truly terrifying place to host such foul denizens. Demons vary immensely in appearance and power, as much as the creatures of our own world vary. They generally have blueish blood and metallic flesh and skin, which can oft react oddly with our atmosphere - some become wreathed in flames, others release hideous acids or belching clouds of darkness. All seem versed in magical abilities to some degree, and the strongest of them possess truly terrifying powers. Luckily they are exceptionally rare, and seem to be much less common in modern times since magic has fallen out of use.") -- _t

tDef(510, "The common man may scoff at the idea of classifying dragons as an intelligent race, but experienced wyrmics know otherwise. Dragons are incredibly long-lived creatures, with some known to survive for thousands of years. Though in their early life they are of a bestial nature, as they advance through the centuries they gain an ever keener and more developed intellect. The eldest of wyrms are sometimes considered the most subtle and intelligent of creatures in Maj'Eyal, capable of telepathic communication and advanced mental abilities, and wyrmics speak of them with the highest reverence.\
\
Dragons come in many shapes and sizes, normally growing from 5' long hatchlings to 20' long mature drakes, with some of the greatest wyrms growing to over 40' in length. They are generally winged, with large lizard-like maws and sharp talons on both their fore and hind legs. They are often noted for the lustrous colour of their scales, normally representing an attunement to one of the key Elements of Eyal. This attunement is unseen in any other race, and some philosophers believe that dragons predate all other races, being formed as raw representations of the elements of nature at the beginning of the world. However this theory may be borne purely from the fanatical delusions of certain wyrmics who have studied the creatures for too long.\
\
All corners of Maj'Eyal show some trace of different types of dragons. The Daikara Pass and surrounding mountain chains are home to a great number of ice and storm dragons. Numerous sand and red dragons can be found in the western desert and hills, and many have been the reports of gigantic sea dragons in the deepest oceans, especially to the south.\
\
Attacks from dragons on humans and halfling settlements are fairly rare, but when they occur they can be truly devastating. Usually they are to feed on livestock, but now and then come attacks from newly matured drakes, seeking out precious metals and gemstones to build up a hoard. Dragon hoards have become a thing of legend, with the greatest wyrms rumoured to protect literal mountains of gold, but in modern times truly sizeable hoards are rare. The dwarves farmed hoarding dragons almost to extinction in the Age of Allure, and most dragons these days retain only modest treasures in their lairs.\
\
Dragons are regularly hunted for their thick scales and their elementally imbued bones. Dragonskin leather is prized amongst armour-workers, as when properly treated it is both light and tough, and oft retains some inkling of the original wyrm's power. Dragon-bone is highly favoured by staff-crafters for its natural attunement to elemental forces, and is sometimes used by fletchers in the crafting of the most delicate yet resilient bows and arrows. However the hunting of dragons for their skin and bones is greatly opposed by many wyrmics, and there is an increasing market for \"naturally harvested\" drake materials - those taken from dragons which have died of natural causes. Still, demand for all dragon materials is strong with exceptionally high prices paid, and many are the greedy souls that lose their lives each year at the fangs and claws of these magnificent creatures.") -- _t

I feel like the myth of a wandering hero has blinded too many with promise of easy fame and riches, with no eye for the other kind of fortune.\
\
Hear me out on this.\
\
Nowadays most don't really recognize how fascinating the world we live in truly is. It is vast, more than you can imagine. I can safely promise, any wild thought you can muster up, dear reader, will not come close to the truth. Such is the breadth of wonders, I would probably dismiss most of what I have seen as myth, be I not there myself. And even then sometimes, I had to wonder whether I could trust my eyes.\
\
Perhaps I'm being too vague, or maybe these promises leave much to be desired. After all, adventuring is not all fun and exotics, it is before all danger and a constant threat of death, or worse. So then if you wish me to be more concrete, think of derelict, crumbling crypts, cults and demons, hungry forests full of monsters and forces beyond time and place. True, there is overwhelming awe, thrill even, but the reason that so little detail reaches you, is because so little live to tell.\
\
What does reach us then, are not people, but objects. Artifacts of great power, legacy of the past. Surely, any drunkard might like to tell tales after a pint or two, but a magical sword is a proof of its own and it keeps quiet of what it has seen. So, a great hero is usually easy to recognize, being practically a walking history book. Clad in half the age of important events which he probably has no idea about.\
\
It is important to remember, that every artifact has a meaning, beings of great power and importance behind them. Stories, that now slowly wane into nothing. This is why it is not artifacts that make an adventurer. It is his great deeds, the will to dare where nobody did before. It is not important if you get known in the process or not, after all, if you were truly great, maybe you will leave behind a legacy of your own.\

Whether by invitation, discovering it on your own, or simply being enough of a thorn in our side to recruit rather than dispose of, you have gained the secrets of chronomancy. The ultimate power of time - the ability to reset and try again if you fail, the ability to save time by seeing the results of investigations before they happen. Though our powers are bound to post-Spellblaze Eyal, they are those of nigh-omnipotence with enough patience.\
\
But trust me - \"enough patience\" is one nasty limiting reagent. You're going to be running out of that fast when you've spent the last week trying to dismantle an Age of Dusk-era house-of-cards system of causally interdependent tyrannies without causing dwarven extinction, and a plague just broke out right when you had things almost perfect, for the sixth time--\

Look. The point is, there's a reason the person who writes the invitations and the mission statements isn't someone out in the field - and you're lucky enough to be working for someone who understands that you need more flexibility than idealism allows. Our squad knows that to stay sane, we have to know when \"time flows forward at a rate of one second per second\" isn't the only rule we have to break. That it's generally okay to skip the trial and just deal with a temporally hazardous jackass as you see fit, if you've foreseen a guilty verdict - as long as your investigations are solid when you actually conduct them (and you do have to do the work once in a while, or you'll only be capable of seeing yourself procrastinating). And if you just need to not be watched, you should know that there are a few decades in the Age of Dusk we and a few other squads recognize as \"fair game\" - whatever experiments you've wondered about or horrors you want to inflict, just keep it to the time period of infinite forgotten evils and it doesn't hurt anything in the grand scheme. Trust me, we've checked - nothing in that time period matters unless you've got another Spellblaze to set off.\
\
But most importantly, you should know: Zemekkys is even lazier than I am, but he has status to maintain. If you continually violate his will, there will come a point at which you will be informed that you have been caught and should stop resisting. Accept whatever fate he doles out for you. If you do not stop, there will come a point where he will be forced to make an example of you so severe that the entire cosmos will notice your non-existence. Obviously we can't be sure how many of us he's done this to (if any) or how it works, but we're pretty sure that the result looks like something starting with a W.\
\
Everyone here wants the same thing - keep spacetime stable, have fun with your powers, cheat at a few lotteries - but we've got cover to maintain and, in theory, an actual job to do if something ever cracks that Sher'Tul shield or the Greigu find a way to bypass a portal-filter. Scratch backs when yours gets scratched, don't make so much noise that the system comes crashing down on your head, and you'll enjoy your stay in eternity.\

At first we escaped and fled, and hid in dark caves. Our numbers grew, though we had to endure squalor and hardship.

The elves and the humans and the dwarves tried to oppose us too, but we would not allow ourselves to be beaten!

Afterwards disease and blight ravaged our people, utterly ruining all the progress we had made.\

We built up our capabilities in secret, waiting for the right moment to strike a decisive vengeance. Garkul the Devourer, the greatest of our race, brought the plans to fruition. Under his awe-inspiring leadership we marched out upon the halfling kingdoms and burnt all before us. What glorious retribution we had! Whole cities were felled beneath our wrath.

We established the Prides there - training camps for our soldiers where they could hone their battle skills before returning to fight the wars in the west.\

- Sayings of Garkul the Devourer#{normal}#\
\
Garkul was the greatest orc to ever live, and the tale of his life is the tale of the greatest age for our race. He united our tribes, drove back the enemy races, conquered west and east, and died with ten thousand bodies at his feet.\
\
He was born in a troubled time, when we lived a life of hiding, capable of only sneak attacks on the other races from our dark caves. He was from a small brood of no notable blood, but at a young age proved himself on the streets as a fierce and intelligent warrior. Note that there could be no one like Garkul in the other races. They coddle their nobility and weaken them, whilst those that endure true hardship are doomed to live a life of servitude. We orcs are all born equal, and every one of us is given the opportunity to fight and show our prowess above others. Only the strong live to rule, and only the smart stay in power.\
\
Garkul formed his own street gang, as those who saw his strength quickly devoted themselves to him. Soon he became powerful enough to take over his whole tribe. But one day he was spotted for a greater fate. Verikor the spellmaker was visiting each tribe, gathering volunteers for his experiments in magic. When he came to Garkul's tribe the young orc laughed at him, and said that all the spells of Eyal could not match the muscles in his left arm. Verikor was impressed by this adolescent display of pride, and moreover saw something else in the youth, and invited Garkul to test his brawn against the strongest of the new breed of mages. Garkul accepted, and the two travelled to Verikor's halls.\
\
Here Garkul was surprised, for the caverns beneath the halls hid thousands of orcs training in the ways of magic. They were highly organised, split into schools of ability and rising ranks, with masters teaching them well in the use of the Art for combat. Verikor explained how he had spent his life studying the effects of the Spellblaze, and experimenting on kidnapped mages from the other races, and this was the culmination of that lifelong research. With young orcs from all the tribes he could build an army of mages that could help their whole race fight back against their enemies. Garkul was clearly stirred by the possibilities this could bring.\
\
Then came the time of the trial, for Garkul had bet that with his left arm alone he could fend off the greatest of wizards. So Verikor brought out his three most advanced students, one trained in fire, one trained in ice, and one trained in blood, and the challenge was to see who could knock the other out first. Garkul accepted with a grin, putting his right arm behind his back as he faced the three mages.\
\
The pyromancer began by shooting a wreath of flames at the fighter, but Garkul dodged with immense speed, and before the mage could cast another spell Garkul was upon him, and swept a vicious uppercut into the caster's jaw, breaking it and instantly knocking him out. Then the cryomancer let loose a hail of ice, but Garkul grabbed the swooning fire mage by his robe and used him as a shield as he ran through the icy storm, till he came to the second caster, tossed aside the inert body, and hooked the ice mage soundly on the temple. With two mages down in just a few seconds he then turned on the corruptor, who backed off in fright. Garkul advanced with a laugh, but as he came near the blood mage cast a hex, and the warrior felt his arm suddenly shrivel up, unusable. With a curse he headbutted the final caster, who fell instantly to the ground, and the hex was broken.\
\
Garkul turned to the amazed Verikor and bowed. \"You have bested me - I had to use my head for the last one.\" But Verikor was in awe of the fighter's skills - his incredible speed, his amazing strength, and his quick-wittedness in battle were all far beyond anything he had seen before. The two talked a while, and Garkul brought forth many ideas for how the army of mages could work together with the warriors and the wilders of the tribes to produce an unequalled force. His eyes were open now to the potential for magic, and his brain wrought together new tactics and strategies for how it could be used in battle.\
\
Verikor kept Garkul as his guest for many months, and though Garkul had no inkling for the Art he learnt many things about how to resist and avoid the effects of magic. Verikor never ceased to be impressed by the young orc's talents, and it became clear to him that here was one who was destined to lead their race to great things.") -- _t

- Sayings of Garkul the Devourer#{normal}#\
\
The next spring Verikor brought Garkul to the tribal council, when each of the leaders of the tribes met. Wargon the elder headed the meeting, as they heard reports from the happenings in each tribe.\
\
Garkul listened patiently until one of the western tribes briefed about an attack on their base by the halflings, and he stirred as he heard about how their warriors had fallen to the Eldoral slingers and mages, but Verikor bade him be still. There were mutterings from some of the other tribal leaders, but Garkul was shocked that none called for an avenging strike.\
\
Wargon stayed silent and contemplative, but when the mutterings died down he raised his voice. \"These are terrible events, but little can be done. To attack back would be to draw attention to ourselves, to invite further destruction. We must remain silent, perhaps-\"\
\
\"Fangless dog!\" shouted Garkul, standing up suddenly, no longer able to control himself. \"You have no teeth! We should fight back, we should teach them a lesson for daring to assault our tribes!\"\
\
Wargon seethed with rage at the insult, and gestured for several guards to chop down the young warrior. Garkul tensed as he saw them reach for their weapons, ready to fight back against the whole room if needs be, but Verikor swiftly stood up to intervene. \"Elder, forgive the boy; he is young and keen for battle. It is my fault for bringing him here, I accept full responsibility.\"\
\
Wargon's eyes turned to slits as he looked at the spellmaker. \"You would take this boy's stead?\" Verikor gravely nodded, and a thin smile crossed the elder's lips. Long had he suspected the mage of building up secret forces, and now he saw a chance to remove a potential rival. He motioned to the nearest guard, who advanced on the unresisting mage and slit his throat.\
\
Garkul remained motionless, staring hard at the elder. Wargon's slitted eyes rested on him for a moment, but the stare made him uneasy. Turning to one of the guards he said, \"I do not like the look in this one's eyes. Put out his right eye, and then let him go.\" Garkul did not flinch as the guard took the knife to his face, and his left eye remained fixed on Wargon as the right was cut open and blood poured down his face.\
\
He returned to his tribe and had the wound tended, but would accept no patch on it, and the name of Garkul One-Eye was laid on him. People asked, \"How do you now intend to stand for leadership of our tribe when you have but half vision?\" But Garkul responded, \"I see more than all others, and I will lead this tribe and more besides.\"\
\
He awaited his vengeance till he deemed the time right, and at the next tribal council he arrived with twenty of his followers. When he was refused entry he batted away the guards with a single swipe of his fist. He marched towards Wargon whilst his warriors surrounded the tribal leaders. \"So, fangless wolf,\" he growled. \"Will you fight me now?\"\
\
Wargon clenched his teeth, and not wanting to appear weak he reached for his daggers and sprung at the challenger. But Garkul grabbed both of his arms, and in a swift movement tore them from their sockets. Then he seized the screaming elder by the head, digging his nails into his flesh, and pulled the face close to his own. He opened his jaw over Wargon's right eye and bit down sharply, shearing the orb from its socket, before tossing back his head and swallowing the eyeball. Then he turned to the other eye and did the same, black blood running down his chin as he chewed through the squelching flesh.\
\
He dropped the twitching body on the ground, bent over it and pummelled his fist down on the wounded head, cracking Wargon's skull apart and smashing out all his teeth. He turned then to the other leaders and cried, \"See?! For each eye one takes from me, I take two! Follow me, and I will kill two halflings for every one they take of us. There will be no more snivelling and sneaking - we will rise up and bring a blaze of wrath across the lands!\" Confronted by Garkul's strength and surrounded by his warriors, the tribal leaders without hesitation all agreed to follow him.\
\
So ended the name Garkul One-Eye, for a new name was born: Garkul the Devourer. The teeth of Wargon he collected and made into a necklace, and he added more teeth to it as he dealt with dissent amongst the tribes, until all followed him without question.") -- _t

- Sayings of Garkul the Devourer#{normal}#\
\
Garkul united the tribes swiftly and effectively. He reorganised them, joining together the warriors and the wyrmics into their own bands, encouraging competition between them. Seeing the strength of the mages he split them in two, one for the elements, and one for corruption and death, and he encouraged them to compete against each other further. He said that only orcs could compete against other orcs, for the other races could never compare. Only through competition with ourselves could we achieve our true strengths.\
\
He organised protective groups around the orcish territories, so that any attacks from the other races were quickly put down. But the halflings saw our increased organisation, and began to enlarge their scouting groups and bolster their patrols. Garkul saw that this could not continue any longer, and that the time was ripe to bring his plans to full fruition. He began to plan an attack on Barton, the largest Eldoral city in the region.\
\
The attack was made in the dead of night. Under the shadow of darkness his army marched towards the city walls, and they were not spotted until they were nearly upon it. When the guards let up a cry of warning they tried to close the city gates, but the orcish mages let loose a barrage of spells that tore the defences apart. The Barton army finally rallied and began to flood out of the city gates to meet their attackers, but Garkul ordered that balls of fire be shot into their midst, splitting the troops apart, so that his fighters could easily slice through the few that came through the gates, whilst the archers shot down those held back by the flames. The pyromancers continued to send conflagrations of flame over the city walls, and as the halflings inside tried to escape their burning homes a new chaos erupted. For Garkul had sent necromancers into the city in advance through the sewers, and hidden by arcane illusion they now began to raise the fallen halflings as their undead minions. People screamed as they saw their deceased loved ones suddenly rise as ghasts and wights to attack them. And no leadership could be found amongst the defenders, as Garkul had sent through stealthed assassins to strike them down at the moment of attack. As all resistance crumbled the great leader then let loose his berserkers and wilders into the city, and they tore through the streets butchering every last opponent. Within a few hours not a single halfling remained alive, and not a single cobblestone in the city was left unstained by their crimson blood. And Garkul's victory was truly transcendent, for not a single orc had been hurt in all the battles.\
\
When his troops asked what should be done next he stayed quiet for a moment, looking at a hill to the south of the city. Then he said, \"Chop down wood from the forest nearby and bring it to the top of that hill. Then gather all the bodies from the city - every part of every man, woman and child - and construct atop the hill a mighty pyre.\" And his army did so, and did it quickly, for the word of Garkul now stood above all else in their minds. When the pyre was finished it was over 80 feet high, and crammed with the bodies of thousands of their victims. As dawn began to glow red on the eastern horizon they lit the pyre, and the flames rose up to make a mighty furnace, incinerating the fallen corpses.\
\
The pyre could be seen for miles around, and the other races sent out scouts to find out what it was. Garkul instructed his troops not to stop them, and the reports came back to the leaders of the other races of a butchery beyond all concept. Some could barely believe the words of their scouts, but the next night the same happened again to another Eldoral city, and the night after several towns in the region were burnt to a cinder. Garkul's army was sweeping forth in a blaze of wrath, and suddenly the peaceful world of the other races was falling apart.\
\
These early victories came easy, but as they advanced they met more resistance, as the races had more forewarning of their attacks. But Garkul was always master of any situation, and his strategy and tactics overcame all defences. And after each victory was always the great pyre, and our armies would chant songs of victory as the flames reached into the cold night sky. The battles would become known as the Pyre Wars, and the flames of conquest would spread across all of Maj'Eyal.\
\
Within three months the Eldoral kingdom was broken, and refugees flooded south to the halfling kingdom of Nargol, desperate to escape the deadly pyres. Garkul then consolidated his forces, building new bases in the conquered lands, before advancing out against the other races. None would escape the wrath of the people that had suffered so long from the attacks of the other races. Centuries of oppression had hardened us, and now the flames of vengeance that rose in our hearts could not be quenched.") -- _t

\
For many years the great conquest could not be held back. Garkul marched across the lands, insufferable of any resistance. The Eldoral were broken, and they fled to their halfling cousins the Nargols in the south. The humans were split into many kingdoms, and Garkul began to pick them off one by one, leaving just a few isolated in the west and south. The Thaloren hid in their dark forests, penned in by the mighty orcish armies. The Shaloren tried to fight, and with their great magics they created grave opposition to the orcish troops, but gradually they were beaten back and forced to retreat to their capital in the south-west. The dwarves viciously defended their halls in the east, and Garkul could not penetrate their cities of stone, but he laid plans in place to take them through caves below.\
\
All the centre of Maj'Eyal was under Garkul's dominion - from the northern wastes to the southern lakes; from the Daikara Mountains to the western ocean. Orc patrols covered every valley and every field, and any enemies found were eradicated. Garkul's support was utterly unwavering, as every orc took new pride in their amazing achievements under his leadership.\
\
But victory was not complete, as many centres of power and resistance still remained, and the Nargol were still a grave threat from the south. Garkul was careful not to overreach, not to spread his forces too thin before victory was assured. He knew he must bide his time and build up his forces to their greatest possible strength.\
\
Then beneath the dwarven city of Reknor our scouts discovered an amazing thing - a Sher'Tul farportal. The blood mages studied it, and after some time they succeeded in activating it, and discovered a new land. It was the lost East, sundered from Maj'Eyal after the great cataclysm. Garkul saw here a great opportunity, and he instructed many thousands of young warriors and mages to be sent over to the east. There they formed training grounds where the military could train and practise to master their techniques before returning to join the wars in the west. Garkul named them the Prides, for he said here was were the strength of our race would lie, and here was what we would be most proud of.\
\
But while Garkul was busy establishing the Prides the Nargol king was planning a strategy of defence. He knew that the orcish armies would come for his kingdom soon, and he drew on the powers of his greatest strategists to prepare a force that could not be overcome. He summoned the mightiest alchemists from all the lands and together they laid plans for a creation that could not be beaten: the giant golem Atamathon.\
\
When Garkul next returned from the east he heard from his spies of great operations afoot in the Nargol kingdom, and he knew that he must face down the halflings. He did not know that it would be his last battle.") -- _t

- Sayings of Garkul the Devourer#{normal}#\
\
Garkul gathered a force together to take on the Nargol kingdom, striking south at their centre of power. It was not a force as strong as he would have liked, for many troops had been sent east to establish the Prides, but he knew he must quell any resistance from the halflings before it was too late.\
\
He marched with care towards the southern city, with minor skirmishes along the way. As he approached the capital he saw the halfling armies ready, with over ten thousand troops organised into units, ready to defend their kingdom. Garkul had only five thousand with him, but he knew that his warriors were far stronger, and that with his tactics they would easily prevail. But still a nervousness was in him, and he advanced his troops with caution.\
\
The orcs reached a tilled field, and the halfling army stood on the other side, waiting. Garkul eyed the ground suspiciously, but as the halfling slingers began to fire at them he knew he must act - he gave the order to attack. His warriors charged with speed towards with enemy, with his mages following behind, but as they neared their foe there was a sudden tumult in the ground. The fighters were knocked back as the earth tore open and a massive hand rose up, followed by a gigantic head. Slowly rising forth from the ground they saw a monster of unparalleled size - it was the giant golem Atamathon. Long had the halfling alchemists worked on it in secret, crafting its body of marble and its joints of voratun, setting a thousand rubies into each of its eyes and imbuing it with unrivalled power. Carefully had the strategists laid the trap, leading Garkul's army to this place with precisely timed skirmishes, waiting for the right moment to reveal their awe-inspiring weapon.\
\
The orcish troops flailed against the golem, battering their weapons against its solid feet, but to no result. The mages fired spells of fire and ice at its chest, but they were reflected away without effect. Then the halfling alchemists stood forth and channelled their energies through the golem, and its ruby eyes glowed brightly before a beam of flames erupted and burned down on the orcish troops. The golem marched forwards, each step crushing dozens of warriors, whilst its beaming eyes tore through the ranks of mages. Then the alchemists joined in throwing bombs, and the slingers fired shot after shot and a great massacre began.\
\
Garkul saw his troops in disarray, and knew that against this new weapon none of his army could prevail. He ran to his wolf-riders and grabbed the greatest beast, a vicious warg over ten feet long, and mounting it he charged into the fray. He rushed the wolf straight towards the giant golem, and made it leap towards the monster's towering chest. The golem swiped down a massive fist that smashed the warg apart, but Garkul jumped at the last moment and grabbed onto the golem's head, and drawing out his axe he swept it into one of the ruby eyes, shattering it.\
\
Then the golem reached with both hands and grabbed Garkul by the arms, and his axe fell to the ground below. Atamathon held tightly to the great orc's limbs in its marble grip, and proceeded to try and rip them off. But Garkul flexed his muscles with all his strength, and resisted the might of the golem, and slowly he began to twist the golem's fists forwards, drawing him closer to monster's head. When he was close enough to that marble brow he smashed his head forwards against it, and the ringing sound of his steel helm hitting the solid stone tore through the air. The golem shuddered a moment, and Garkul headbutted it again, and his steel helm was torn from his pate. Once more he thrust his head forward, and the impact made a deep gash across his temples, but the thick marble of the golem's head was also dented. Another headbutt was launched forth, and two more as the golem's skull began to crack apart and its legs gave way beneath it. Garkul turned his bloodied head to the sky and roared before delivering a final fatal plunge of his head. His brow met the thick marble, and the golem's head shattered apart beneath the force. The golem collapsed, and Garkul with it. Thus fell the giant golem Atamathon, and its like has not been seen again.\
\
At this the halflings were dismayed, for though the orcish troops were decimated their mighty weapon was also broken. Then they advanced towards the ruins and saw movement within, and before them rose Garkul the Devourer. His head was gashed and bloodied, and his arms were badly bruised, but he had recovered his axe and now faced them with a grin.\
\
He saw he was alone now, for what had remained of his army had been finished off whilst he had battled the golem, and though they had fought well there still remained ten thousand troops before him. But he grinned, for he was a warrior true, and never more happy than when on the battlefield, facing foes insurmountable. He charged.\
\
The bodies soon piled up in his wake as he tore through the halfling troops. He shrugged off blows against him, and swung his axe before him. He cleaved through skulls and sliced through armour and flesh and bones. When they tried to grab his weapon from him he punched them away, or bit through their throats. He laughed as he danced around his enemies, blood spurting up from their wounds and raining down over his face. Hundreds fell beneath his blade before the axe cracked and broke, but still he gripped the shaft and stabbed and clubbed and swiped.\
\
Then the alchemists threw their bombs at him, scorching his flesh. And the archers and slingers fired at him, their arrows piercing his skin and their shots bruising his body. But Garkul roared a mighty warshout, and the arrows and shots in the air were shattered, and the ground before him tore apart. He grabbed two waraxes from the bodies nearby and rushed towards his attackers, raining down blows on them with each hand. The halflings surrounded him, and attacks came from all sides, but he carried on fighting furiously.\
\
But the fight could not carry on forever. A stab from a sword crippled his leg, and a blast from a bomb blinded his eye, and though he continued to battle, wading through the corpses around him, blood now seeped through cuts all over his body. The blades of the axes he wielded became cracked and dented, and he was left wielding the shafts as clubs. He swung them through the troops before him, until his movements slowed to a stop, and the alchemists rained down bomb after bomb until his charred corpse moved no more. So died Garkul the Devourer, though his body stayed upright even in death, clutching his weapons above his head, and standing atop a field of over ten thousand bodies. For when the halflings counted their numbers after, only a few hundred remained.\
\

I have begun work on several of the females. They are being kept in a coma for the duration of the experiments - it's far better that way. Initially I have subjected them to very high levels of wild infusion and arcane regeneration fields, whilst also keeping a direct feed into their stomachs high in protein. Corrupted blood is being pumped into their ovaries with a temporal acceleration field surrounding them. The leaders of each Pride have donated their seed for use in the experiments.\
\
Initial results have mostly been immensely successful. Body mass has grown significantly, especially in the abdominal region. One has even begun developing extra ovaries and sexual organs. I have managed to increase their fertility immensely, and the stimulated foetal growth rate means that new orcs take only eight weeks from conception to birth. The young also seem to be progressing in their development at a very advanced pace, with particularly accelerated muscle development.\

With greater advances in accelerating the foetal growth stage we are now seeing new orcs every few days! I believe this can be pushed even further.\

Though the wombs operate at an advanced rate, we are keeping their vital organs suppressed to extend their lifespans. Perhaps they can live for hundreds, if not thousands of years.\

Pumping nutrients directly into their stomach is proving a difficulty with the increased activity in the abdominal region.

How glad you must be to hear from your \"renegade\" son. Do not worry overmuch; I keep myself and my group well hidden from your petty Council. I know how you fret about your status amongst those fools.\
\
I write to you to tell you that I have discovered something wonderful. In all my travels I could not have imagined a place so perfect as this. It is a remnant of the Great Spellblaze, a scar in the very fabric of Eyal. How beautiful it is! Ah, and what strength lies here too! You cannot possibly imagine, sitting idly in your little hall of stone.\
\
You are wrong about the Spellblaze, of this I am certain. Seeing this has opened my eyes fully. The success of our ancestors cannot be denied! The power unleashed was tremendous, and still it lasts, 2646 years later. So much power still remains, untapped! You ramble on about the destruction it caused, but I cannot help but think you are exaggerating about the deaths. And were not the orcs also defeated? The grand purpose was achieved. Oh, you prattle about the plagues and blights, but I have seen how those dirty humans live, and those halflings in their grimy holes. Pestilence is rife amongst them. Besides, it seems clear to me that a little help from natural selection can only serve to improve the lesser races. Indeed, I have done some experiments which show just that. But alas, I think with your short vision you would only be disgusted by my advances.\
\
My Rhaloren have come far in the world, and we have learned many things. Oft we have had to flee the terrible Ziguranth and their Death Wilders, but we have pulled through by force of will and grown stronger every day. Here our pilgrimage ends, for here is where we shall truly come into being. You should hear the voices here, screaming from the other side. You should hear their glorious cacophony! The Spellblaze is almost complete; it only needs our gentle push to bring everything to full fruition. The walls between worlds have been worn thin here, and with my strength we can break through to realms of power beyond belief. Such power I shall have! And with it I shall rend forces through this broken world that shall make the Spellblaze seem a happy memory. Eyal will be put to right, and our mighty place restored at the head of all other races! For the Rhaloren this shall truly be the Age of Ascendancy. For the lesser races, herewith comes their Age of Torment.\

As I write to you our final plans are in motion. Sleep well when you read this, for it may well be your last night before the Great Torment begins.\

Too long has Eyal suffered the torture of their presence, and so we must fight with all the powers that nature can give us.\
\
Mobility is key against spell-slinging warlocks and witches. One must rush with full speed towards them and hack them down, not giving them time to utter a spell of attack or defence. Against multiple opponents this could be difficult, and retreat to less open space is often vital. Do not consider this cowardice, for you play the weaker hand and must take all advantage you can acquire. Get into a tighter environment, and keep behind a concealed corner until they are right upon you, before unleashing all of your strength against them without warning.\
\
Necromancers and fell conjurers can present a great threat when they summon their dark minions to overwhelm you. Oft it is best to take out the wizard first, though it presents risk. You must raise your will and suppress all pain until you come right upon him, and then strike him down quickly before retreating to a safer area. Stunning or dazing the caster before they have a chance to summon aid can also help immensely.\
\
Hexes and curses can wreak terror upon you, and you would do well to have an infusion that removes these and other blighted magic effects when facing dread occultists. Infusions to augment your natural healing are also a must for difficult battles.\

Preferably they should be killed in a way that utterly removes any means for the body to recover through arcane force. Remember that coming back from the dead is no alien feat to these abominations.\
\
Beheading is simple and effective, especially in a hurry, but ideally their other limbs should be removed too and sealed in separate metal cases wrapped in willow-bark.\
\
Devouring by animals is sometimes used, but is not advised, as it can at the very least can cause severe diarrhoea in the animals, and at the worst can leave you facing a pack of fire-breathing hell hounds corrupted by the mana-wielder's aura.\
\
Freezing is ineffective, and no magic-user can ever be frozen to death, in spite of what rumours you may have heard. Anyone you have heard of that was frozen to death was either not a mage or was pretending.\
\
Burning is popular amongst the less educated towns, but typically no witch or wizard of power would ever allow themselves to be caught, bound and put to stake without finding means of escape. Simply putting together the necessary firewood takes too long, even if stocked in advance. Usually those executed in this manner are magic-sympathisers rather than true magic users. Whilst strictly speaking this does not carry the penalty of death it does well to set an example for others and to warn arcane users to stay well away from the community.\
\
The best method, if time and situation allows, is to very slowly slice the caster to death. One should have them securely bound in a sealed room, with willow-bark or beech-wood around their wrists and cranium. One should start by slowly slicing off the toes, fingers and other extremities, before slicing through all the limbs and finally the torso. Do not cut open the skull, in case resident demons escape. The head should be put into a metal box and incinerated for 24 hours with the rest of the remains. Extremely sharp instruments are needed for the job, and do not be surprised if they need re-sharpening several times during the process, as it is a typical warlock's trick to harden their bones before the procedure as a final act of spite.\

\
I am truly sorry about this; had circumstances been different, we could've been allies, my weapons and magic letting you fight the hordes of threats to Maj'Eyal.  As it stands, however, your continued existence is highly inconvenient to me.\
\
See, my funding comes from the merchants of Last Hope, who want a functioning portal and will stop paying once they have one; furthermore, my portal research has proved to be a very useful cover story for the other experiments I'm conducting here.  Now that you've gotten a portal working, and will want to use it in full view of the city, I'm out of a job - and there is so much more knowledge for me to find!  The medical applications of necromancy, for one - the only other source of data on this subject went missing shortly after her husband's death, and everyone else has a Ziguranth-like fervor against the idea of using that magic baseline in any way whatsoever.  Also, selective drake breeding programs, experiments on zealots to shatter their anti-magic barriers, studying demons to learn more about their altered biologies and steal that magic for our own militaries...  I could go on, but I'd rather not waste enchanted ink.  The point is, you using the portal without further injury would mean an end to my experiments.  Ideally, you need to disappear, but if you were to emerge from my basement, wounded and raving with wild eyes about impossible beasts in the basement of my humble tower...  well, that'd just further my case that portals need more research to be used safely, wouldn't it?\
\
#{italic}#As you move on to the next paragraph, you notice that everything above it has faded away, and the scroll is beginning to grow warm in your hands.#{normal}#\
\
Worry not, though - you can still help the world, by devoting yourself to my quest for knowledge!  My sources have told me that you've grown exponentially more powerful since you first started making a name for yourself, and you continue to cause prodigious amounts of destruction.  The modified portal I used on you had about a 33% chance of draining some of the power you've accumulated; if you're feeling exhausted, simply lay down and wait for my imp servants to collect you for further testing.  If you aren't, however: I've sealed the way up, and placed the switches in each of the subject holding pens on this floor.  You can fight your way through them, and I'll be watching to see how a creature of your power fares against different types of foes.  I'm sure you'll want to get to the top floor and kill me in revenge, and I encourage you to try!  You may die, but the data you provide will be immortal - and if I can have my drolem subdue you non-lethally, I'll send you back to the bottom and repeat the experiment with tweaked parameters.  We can keep repeating this until I find your breaking point, or figure out what makes you so special, at which point you'll be held until I can work on a reliable method of controlling your mind.  And on the off chance that you do actually manage to kill me...  try not to do too much damage to my notes, please?  Knowledge and progress are bigger matters than either of us; don't let your spite doom thousands of lives that could rely on my research in the future.\

Couldn't we have tried to learn more about the Sher'Tul _before_ desperation pushed us into blowing up half of the world?  No, that was \"forbidden\" magic, \"too powerful for mortals to tamper with,\" right up until we realized we needed all that power after all.

Construction begins tomorrow - I've got three separate sets of contractors lined up to work on it, so none know the tower's full layout, and I've made arrangements with powerful merchants in Last Hope so I can conduct some of my experiments publicly (they want working portals for trade, and I convinced them I won't cause another Spellblaze trying to make one), providing a convenient cover story for the more...  controversial experiments.

Setting up a portal took surprisingly little effort - conjured replicas of a Blood-Runed Athame and a Resonating Diamond work perfectly for setting up a portal, as it turns out, even if it burns them out after making just one.  This solution wouldn't work for the Orb of Many Ways, given that if it shorts out after one use, that means you're trapped on the other side of the portal, so I started working on a more tangible replica.  I noticed that most of them were disrupted by some form of interference, maybe echoes from the Spellblaze; my latest attempt at a more permanent orb was more of a curiosity than anything, an attempt to use those waves as constructive interference to lock onto their source.  I tossed a bandit through (my drolem's flight and relative silence have proven to be very convenient for securing test subjects!) with it tied to him, expecting him to pop into some magical maelstrom, quickly teleport back, and promptly die of terrible burn wounds (like the last four).\

I didn't get a bandit back.  I got an imp.\
\
My drolem grabbed it with its jaws, as usual, but I told it to back off on seeing the imp wasn't armed and wasn't even trying to cast any spells.  I apologized, treated its wounds, then asked it to explain what happened to my test subject.  Apparently, the demons have been running their own portal experiments!  The test subject was unharmed when he popped up in their laboratory; after the demons \"questioned\" him (boiling tar was involved), they realized that another inquisitive mind was on the other side, and hoped to communicate and possibly trade data with that person.  I've managed to make more progress than the demons have - either I'm a genius, or I've severely overestimated the threat the demons pose!\
\
I've \"officially\" agreed to their deal - they'll supply me with materials, subjects, and what little progress they've made, and in return I've developed a modified orb that'll give them readings when it's used in a portal.  Needless to say, the readings are all bogus, and if they actually try to use those readings to make a second portal of their own, it'll blow them to bits.  The data they've given me has been VERY useful!  I've used it to construct a second altar from scratch - it still has some links to the demonic realm, but a single teleport with a genuine Orb of Many Ways will recalibrate it and cut those off completely, letting me get away scot-free with my knowledge and treasures, and preventing the demons from reaching me again.\

Soaring birds, mighty bears and ice-breathing dragons all abound in towering mountains, deep oceans and luscious forests. And we are part of this glorious environment, with our thoughts and strengths and all our wondrous capabilities. Truly we live in a fantastic world, and we should be glad to have a place amongst the wonders of Maj'Eyal.\
\
But some are not content. Some seek to pervert the wonders of the world with unnatural powers. With arcane forces they rip the threads of nature apart and sew it back however they see fit, uncaring of the damage they cause. Sometimes it is out of curiosity or a misplaced desire to do good, but normally it is out of greed and malice and a perverse obsession with power. Even those who enter into the banes of magic with good intentions inevitably end up doing harm and becoming themselves corrupted by the gross forces they tamper in.\
\
History teaches us well the dangers of these forces. First were the Sher'Tul, of which we know little, but we do know that they manipulated magic to strengths beyond the dreams of current mages. And they led themselves to their own utter destruction. Alas that the lesson was not learnt by the younger races. The first recorded war in our history is between the humans and halflings for control of Sher'Tul ruins. Magic was used in those wars and the battles only stopped after two thousand years of slaughter left both sides too crippled to carry on fighting. It was in this time that our order was formed, and we tried to stop the insanity and the bloodshed. Alas that we failed.\
\
The weakening of our peoples by the magic-fuelled fighting left us then open to attacks by the orcs, whose surging numbers nearly overwhelmed us. But instead of relying on our own strengths and our natural defences, the foolish elves decided that only the arcane forces could save us. How very wrong they were... Their insidious mages tapped the vile powers of the Sher'Tul ruins and unleashed catastrophic waves of energy that burned half the world to a cinder. Mountains crumbled, lakes were boiled, and raging fires stripped the land of all life. The devastation can truly never be fully stated. But it is unforgettable and utterly unforgiveable. The Shaloren try to deny responsibility, but the blood of millions is on their hands.\
\
The suffering that followed the unfortunate survivors lasted centuries, as the unnatural forces created black plagues that wiped out kingdoms and made huge swathes of land uninhabitable. Dread warlocks and necromancers took advantage of the chaos to raise armies and gain power. Kor'Pul was the deadliest of these, and our order fought long and hard to kill him time and time again. We fought viciously to protect the people of Maj'Eyal from all the terrible pains of this time.\
\
But our efforts could not prevent the ultimate tragedy that followed. The plagues were mere echoes of the Spellblaze as its horrible effects rebounded across the land. One dark and terrible day those echoes rose in resonance, and a cataclysmic force tore through the heart of our world. The land was rent in two, earthquakes spouted forth magma from the ground, and the eastern edge of our land was torn away and sunk into the deepest oceans. It was a tragedy beyond comparison.\
\
As our civilisations slowly recovered the orcs began to increase in numbers, and it became clear then that they too had learned the dark arts. For centuries we suffered their attacks, and only by a unification of the races did we manage to finally contain them and wipe them out. Our order was vital in suppressing their pyromancers and blood mages, and many of our people bravely gave up their lives to protect the western armies and towns from destruction.\
\
But we are not clear of danger yet. Magic still exists, though oft it lies secret and hidden. Memories of the dark days have waned, and one can even see alchemists and enchanters walking openly in the streets, unheeding of the pain their ilk have brought to our world. But worse exists... Secret societies hide themselves in unknown places, plotting and scheming to bring further destruction on Maj'Eyal. Dark cults exist in quiet isolation, kidnapping innocents and performing vile ceremonies. We try our best to hunt these monsters down, to root them out from their fell dens and bring an end to their depraved plans. Yet we must try harder, for our world is in mortal peril if these fiends are allowed to act unhindered.\
\
We must never forget the terrors of the Great Evil, and the suffering brought upon us by those who choose to corrupt nature with arcane powers. Be wary in your travels, and be thorough in your duties. Our fight is difficult, but it is just and true, and not until all Maj'Eyal is cleansed of the impurities of magic can we ever know peace. We are the protectors of the world, and by our strength and our union with nature we shall be its saviours.\

tDef(71, "I used to be a potion merchant in Derth. I brewed alchemical tonics and elixirs for locals and travellers. My trade was good, and I lived very happily from the gold I earned. For a young woman to have such a business I was very proud.\
\
One day however several people in the town fell ill from a mystery disease. Rumours spread that my potions were to blame, and people stopped coming to my shop. My business was in ruins, and I soon ran the risk of becoming destitute. Then one of the elders died, and though he had been ill for some time, I was blamed for his death. People said I had laid a hex on him, and murmurs arose of witchcraft.\
\
I still remember how peaceful the evening had seemed when the townsfolk came for me. I was looking up at the brightness of the stars and the clear crescent Summertide moon, thinking of how I should restart my business, when I heard shouts from the distance. I saw the crowd appear from round the corner, advancing with their torches. I screamed for help, but they broke through my door, smashed through my windows and grabbed me. They dragged me outside and set their torches to my house. I was stripped to my skin and beaten heavily whilst they cursed and jeered, and even the man who had been my fiancé spat on my face and cursed me.\
\
They pulled me over grass and stone to the town square, and though half-blinded by the tears and my swollen flesh I could still make out the wooden stake they were erecting. I tried to cry out, I tried to beg for mercy, but their response was to hold me down by my throat and pull out my tongue with the blacksmith's tongs. As I coughed up blood they put me against the wooden pole and used barbed cords to tie my wrists to it above my head. The pain was unbearable and I passed out, and did not wake until I could feel the burning at my feet. The crowd were cheering as the smoke began to wrap around me, and they cheered louder with every pained scream I released from my lungs.\
\
I was choking from the smoke, barely able to breathe, and I could no longer feel my legs. Just when I felt my consciousness slipping away again I heard a commotion and a woman's voice shouted out, \"She is no witch!\" Then I saw some people coming towards me, and at the front was a halfling woman in dark armour. She rushed towards me, unheeding of the flames, and with a swift flick from her long sword she cut my bonds. She caught me as I fell and pulled me away from the fire, laying me down on the ground. I saw her soft face above mine as she whispered to me, \"Tell me child, do you reject magic in all its forms?\" I nodded my head - I could not say no to those bright eyes. She wiped the tears streaming down my face and kissed my forehead. \"Then you will be safe - rest now.\" At once I passed out.\
\
When I awoke I was in another village in a soft bed. There were wrappings round my legs and bandages covering the cuts and bruises over the rest of my body. Healers tended to me, using natural remedies and herbal balms. The halfling woman would come and see me every day to check up on me. I longed for her every visit. She would speak to me sometimes. She explained how the townsfolk weren't to blame for their actions. It was all the mages' fault. They were corrupting the world, spreading chaos, and turning people against each other. I realised I was wrong for ever brewing potions - they were infested with arcane energies and could only bring harm to the world.\
\
She explained how she and her friends were helping to save the world, to rid our lands of all magic. And she has saved me. Not just from a terrible death, but also from the evil influences of the arcane. Even if I still had a tongue I could not find words to express my thanks to her, and my joy at the new life I lead, free from the abominations of magic. Thanks to her help I can now walk again with the aid of a crutch, and I can find true happiness in my rightful place in nature.\
\
I have no voice now to tell my story to others, and so I write it down instead, and I spread it to the winds. I have suffered from my contact with magic, and others will suffer too. Do not trust in the terrible powers of these devious arts. They will only betray you and bring you to harm. Turn your back on magic, and make others repent too. Find your own salvation in nature's joys before it is too late.\

Actually...  You fight in a more subtle way than most, do you not?

\
It has been one hundred and twenty-two years since the Allied Kingdoms were established under the rule of #14fffc#Toknor#ffffff# and his wife #14fffc#Mirvenia#ffffff#.\
Together they ruled the kingdoms with fairness and brought prosperity to both Halflings and Humans.\
The King died of old age fourteen years ago, and his son #14fffc#Tolak#ffffff# is now King.\
\
The Elven kingdoms are quiet. The Shaloren Elves in their home of Elvala are trying to make the world forget about their role in the Spellblaze and are living happy lives under the leadership of #14fffc#Aranion Gayaeil#ffffff#.\
The Thaloren Elves keep to their ancient tradition of living in the woods, ruled as always by #14fffc#Nessilla Tantaelen#ffffff# the wise.\
\
The Dwarves of the Iron Throne have maintained a careful trade relationship with the Allied Kingdoms for nearly one hundred years, yet not much is known about them, not even their leader's name.\
\
While the people of Maj'Eyal know that the mages helped put an end to the terrors of the Spellblaze, they also did not forget that it was magic that started those events. As such, mages are still shunned from society, if not outright hunted down.\
Still, this is a golden age. Civilisations are healing the wounds of thousands of years of conflict, and the Humans and the Halflings have made a lasting peace.\
